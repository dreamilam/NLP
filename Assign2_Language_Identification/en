of all celebrated as a national symbol by library of oslo with funding from the norwegian his plays were considered scandalous to many of his when of family life and propriety largely held sway in and any challenge to them was considered immoral and work examined the realities that lay behind many possessing a revelatory nature that was disquieting to many ibsen largely founded the modern stage by introducing a critical eye and free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of plays were expected to be with noble protagonists pitted against darker every drama was expected to result in a morally appropriate meaning that goodness was to bring and immorality ibsen challenged this notion and the beliefs of his times and shattered the illusions of his henrik ibsen was born to knud ibsen and marichen a relatively merchant in the small port town of which was primarily noted for shipping he was a descendant of some of the oldest and most distinguished families of including the paus ibsen later pointed out his distinguished ancestors and relatives in a letter to norwegian shortly after his birth his fortunes took a significant turn for the his mother turned to religion for and his father began suffering from severe the characters in his plays often mirror his and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark private secrets hidden from it is not surprising that there is only one known photograph of ibsen in which he is at ibsen left he moved to the small town of to become an apprentice and began writing in he fathered an illegitimate child with a maid whom he while ibsen did pay some money for fourteen he never met his illegitimate who ended up as a poor ibsen went to renamed intending to attend the he soon cast off the idea earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance preferring to commit himself to his first the tragedy was published under the when he was only but it was not his first play to be received little ibsen was determined to be a although he was not to write again for some he spent the next several years employed at the in where he was involved in the production of more than plays as a and during this period he did not publish any new plays of his despite failure to achieve success as a he gained a great deal of practical experience at the norwegian experience that was to prove valuable when he continued ibsen returned to kristiania in to become the creative director of national he married the same year and she gave birth to their only the couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and ibsen became very disenchanted with life in in he left christiania and went to in in he was not to return to his native land for the next and when he returned it was to be as a noted however his next was to bring him the critical acclaim he along with a measure of financial as was his next to which famously composed the although ibsen read excerpts of the philosopher and traces of the influence are evident in it was not until after that ibsen came to take kierkegaard initially annoyed with his friend georg brandes for comparing brand to ibsen nevertheless read and next play was consciously informed by madness and the absurd isbn the intellectual with ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgments into the exploring what he termed the of his next series of plays are often considered his golden when he entered the height of his power and becoming the center of dramatic controversy across ibsen moved from italy to in here he spent years writing the play he himself regarded as his main dramatizing the life and times of the roman emperor although ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire very few shared his and his next works would be much more ibsen moved to in and published in the play is a scathing criticism of the blind acceptance of traditional roles of men and women in victorian ibsen followed with another scathing commentary on victorian in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its the pastor had advised her to marry her then despite his and she did so in the belief that her love would reform but she was not to receive the result she was her philandering continued right up until his and the result is that her son is even the mention of was but to show that even a person who followed ideals of morality had no protection against that was beyond hers was not the noble life which victorians believed would result from fulfilling duty rather than following those idealized beliefs were only the of the haunting the in ibsen went even in earlier controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the but they were on the small scale of individual in controversy became the primary and the antagonist was the entire one primary message of the play is that the who stands is more often than the mass of who are portrayed as ignorant and the victorian belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be a notion ibsen in enemy of the ibsen chastised not only the or elements of society but also the of the he illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally enemy of the was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous the plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of the protagonist is a a pillar of the the town is a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public the doctor discovers that the water used by the bath is being contaminated when it seeps through the grounds of a local he expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with but instead he is declared an of the by the who band against him and even throw stones through his the play ends with his complete it is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the due to the unwillingness to face as audiences by now expected of his next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and this time his attack was not against the victorians but against overeager reformers and their always the ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political including his is considered by many to be finest and it is certainly the most it tells the story of gregers a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend hjalmar over the course of the play the many secrets that lie behind the apparently happy home are revealed to who insists on pursuing the absolute or the of the among these father impregnated his servant then married her off to hjalmar to legitimize the another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder werle and while hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary his wife is earning the household ibsen displays masterful use of despite his insistence on gregers never says what he thinks but only and is never understood until the play reaches its gregers hammers away at hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the is not his blinded by insistence on absolute he disavows the seeing the damage he has gregers determines to repair and suggests to hedvig that she sacrifice the wild her wounded to prove her love for alone among the recognizes that gregers always speaks in and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement gregers makes which does not contain kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of only too late do hjalmar and gregers realize that the absolute truth of the is sometimes too much for the human heart to in late in his career ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of victorian in such

been recognized as a potential problem from the earliest unmanned but on apollo they had been amplified by an unexpected interaction with the cavitation in the mitigating pogo on aerospace corporation crosslink winter later missions included which had been under development since before apollo those modifications solved the they entailed the addition of a helium gas reservoir in the center line to dampen pressure an automatic cutoff for the center engine in case this and simplified propellant valves on all five as the spacecraft was on its way to the at a distance of kilometers from the number two one of two tanks contained in the is important to note that the report of the apollo review does not refer to this incident as an instead detailing how the oxygen tanks were designed with rupture disks and other safeties to a catastrophic this explosion caused damage to other parts of the service the number one oxygen because the relied on the oxygen tanks to generate damage to number one tank

the spacecraft back to to enter this a significant course correction was this would normally have been a simple using the sm but the s did not know exactly how much damage the service module had and did not want to risk firing the main therefore the course correction was performed by firing the descent an option settled upon after extensive discussion among the engineers on the the initial maneuver to change to a free return trajectory was made within hours of the after passage around the the descent engine was fired again for a burn in order to accelerate the return to only one more descent engine burn was for a minor course considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from both the crew and the s to work out how to the craft for the safe with much of the world

replacement but they were the wrong shape to fit the an adapter then had to be fabricated from materials in the the astronauts called it the view of the apollo lunar module and the during the apollo due to reduced temperatures on the return leg of the there was extensive water condensation in the there was some fear that this condensation could seriously damage the electronics of the command module by causing a short until the electronics were it was impossible to know whether this would the equipment worked normally when partly due to the extensive design modifications made to the cm after the fire aboard as the time for into atmosphere nasa took the unusual step of jettisoning the service module before the lunar so pictures of the sm could be taken for later when the crew saw the damaged service they reported that the access panel covering the oxygen tanks and fuel which extended the entire length of the had been blown the crew returned unharmed to although haise had a as a result of the scarcity of potable water on the damaged ship and the difficulty of urine crew was instructed to store urine and other waste products on board instead of dumping them into to avoid altering the trajectory of the account of apollo by james nasa although the explosion forced the mission to be the crew was fortunate that it occurred on the first leg of the when they had maximum of

by another failure in the oxygen at around hours and minutes into the the oxygen tank quantity gauge went over and stayed as a result of this and to assist in determining the the crew was asked to perform stirs more often than originally in the original mission the stir which blew out the tank would have occurred after the lunar stir that saved the lives of apollo jerry retrieved january following the explosion on apollo led to a lengthy investigation of the underlying based on detailed manufacturing records and logs of mission the oxygen tank failure was tracked to a combination of multiple they were not critical but together they led to near disaster for apollo such as liquid oxygen or liquid require great care in and most storage containers holding them are unsealed so that pressure from expanding gas will not cause the container to the liquid oxygen tanks were made capable of safely holding liquid oxygen at pressures for years before it because of their design and each tank was able to hold several hundred pounds of the highly pressurized liquid to supply the craft with fuel for and water from the byproducts of the the very characteristics that made the tank useful made internal inspection the tank was made of several basic components that were relevant to the these were the basic and operational problems that led to the following the established protocol for crew rotation on apollo missions the original prime crew for apollo was the back up crew for that would have seen mercury veteran command the mission with crew being they were the backup crew for the historic the director of flight crew operations bumped cooper from the position in favor of veteran who recovered from an yet successful operation to correct an inner ear in addition to cooper was also bumped due to his criticism toward the nasa criticisms that go back to the days of his preparation for the mission that almost led to him being grounded and replaced by shepard due to an unauthorized flyby of the mercury operations office at cape in a change from the usual the prime crews of and were to afford shepard more time to two days before the backup lunar module pilot contracted from one of his exposing the main although lovell and haise had had rubella as command module pilot had and the flight surgeons grounded replacing him with this may have been a blessing in disguise for him mattingly never developed and later flew on and retiring from both nasa and the navy with the rank of mattingly was also using the to map out a plan for the astronauts to get the module going again using the limited power supply they had there was no time to properly replace the original on bore so jim lovell was given a replacement to put over the original plaque once they landed on the because the lunar landing was never lovell kept the which is one of the few mementos from the mission that he has on display at his as a result of following the the altitude of apollo over the was approximately km greater than the corresponding orbital altitude on the remaining apollo lunar this could mean an record for human not even superseded as of the variation in distance between earth and the owing to the of the orbit about is much larger than so it is not certain whether the actual distance from earth was greater than that of all other apollo listed this flight as having the absolute altitude record for a manned and lovell should have received a certificate from them attesting to this wrote in the book later renamed that apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces of the only other item he possessed regarding the apollo mission was a letter from the splashdown point was se of american samoa and km from the recovery superstitious people have

its as the series gained a much wider following in the united it was named rpg vault game of the year for the judgment ring from returns with many modifications and battle has been greatly expanded by different types of attacks as well as combo an element of physics has been added to battles as which links to the types of combo attacks which can be in players are able to customise the judgment ring to their own preferences with the introduction of two new ring hit area expand and strike making the game easier or more challenging to the depending on what they several ring types are also introduced to cater to the different players practice ring for normal ring for technical ring for veterans and auto ring for gamers who simply are just too lazy to aim at the judgment a worthy mention of the new battle mechanism would be the introduction of the crest magic where players are able to equip crests to certain characters that would allow them to cast different types of elemental along the players are able to collect new crests and use more powerful the crests may also be positioned in a key item known as positioning the crests correctly will unlock new spells for each crest for a

angle and knock depending on the of the opponent be able to do more damage when connecting a combo during if an attack with an inappropriate hit class is used to continue a the end result is a missed or a combo for a standard hit will simply push an enemy behind while this allows for any other type of hit class attack to be connected to do a a high angle and knock down combo attack is another similar say if a knock down attack is applied to an enemy who has a weight followed by a high angle it will most probably miss since the enemy is still knocked down at that moment when the combo attack is combo shortcuts are also introduced where players are able to assign attacks onto the controller this reduces the time taken to create a combo attack as one character can attack immediately after another with a simple press of the this makes the game more challenging as players have to decide quickly what kind of attack they should follow up next as the combo shortcut menu appears only

metalworkers called s or modern armorers and swordsmiths still ply their trade although to a more limited their products are oriented toward those who pursue various traditional and as props for film and some modern amateur smiths also make swords and smaller blades for the technical challenge they s have been made of many different materials over the centuries and with a variety of tools and while there are many criteria for evaluating a generally the three key criteria are strength and a good sword has to be hard enough to hold an edge along a length which can range from inches to more than inches and at the same time it must be strong enough and flexible enough that it can absorb massive shocks at just about any point along its length and not crack or finally it should be balanced along its length so that it can be easily although many functional swords are purposefully balance has a great deal to do with preference and is not a necessary sword fabrication breaks down into roughly three heat treating and depending on many factors such as base location and era these processes might overlap or be dispensed with swords can be shaped by a variety of metalworking in some times and places one technique has been used in others combinations have been the primary techniques are and stock stock removal shapes the sword from prepared stock that is larger in all dimensions than the finished sword by grinding and while the technique has been available for centuries it was not widely used for making swords until the or century as it is wasteful of the raw where iron and steel are plentiful this method is frequently used as it requires less skill and in places and times where iron and steel have been more rare and valuable stock removal has not been used except as part of the finishing uses heat to bring the material to a malleable the material is then hammered to typically using hammer and anvil together with specialized set and fuller tools depending on the particular there are a variety of forging techniques for sword making and many variations upon the techniques employed in different places and times tend to affect the style of the resulting much of the development and selection of techniques has been driven by the type and availability of raw broadly if metal supply is limited blades have tended to be similarly when the supply of steel has been techniques for building up the basic billet from which a sword would be forged by welding together iron and steel or different types and grades of steel were our modern knowledge of historical techniques is limited in some historically sword fabrication has high military just as the techniques of producing modern weapons are often closely the techniques developed for creating superior swords were also guarded and if in most techniques the basic generally iron are shaped into a bar or billet at this stage if several metals are to be used they will be combined by welding to form the in some notably the traditional folded steel blades of the billet might be folded and welded back on itself creating layers of steel of different in others longer bars or rods of steel and iron might be welded edge to to create the basic billet placing the softer iron inside with the steel at the core and once the billet is created it is drawn out generally tapering to the and the technique of fullering might be used to create a ridge or ridges down the length of the whether single or the primary purpose to give the blade greater structural strength relative to its the final step of and one that affects both the finishing and the heat treatment is the blade would be carefully and evenly heated and then cooled the point of normalizing is to remove the stresses which may have built up within the body of the blade while it was being during the forging process the blade might be heated and cooled differentially creating some parts might be hammered more than some areas hammered enough to if these stresses are left in the blade they could affect the finishing and when it came time to heat treat the the hardening and tempering might not be as potentially enough stress could be added that the blade would be weak in weak enough that it could fail under enough encompasses several processes including hardening and often the process is called but that process refers to just one of the several a detailed discussion of heat treating is not germane to this those who are interested are encouraged to follow the link to the heat treatment article and explore that article and its related until the advent of new steel alloys over the last century most tools and weapons of bronze or even copper were heat treated at one or more stages of their simply put the processes of heat treating soften or harden during fabrication the metal might be softened to relieve stresses built up from forging and differential and to make the metal easier to engrave or as one of the last processes in fabrication the blade would be hardened and if the sword was made of steel in whole or part it would then be tempered making the blade less brittle and more the heating of the metal forces the usually crystalline lattice of molecules to become more and the quenching then forces them back into a crystalline because of this rapid the reformed crystals tend to be inhibiting the movement of the molecules in relation to each thus greatly increasing the hardness and brittleness of the hardening the metal lets the metal hold shape better and therefore hold an edge longer but hardness is at the cost of given the intended use of a sword the blade must be strong as so the hardness is eased or tempered in the case of steel blades to give the blade strength and flexibility as hardening and tempering of any knife or is with due to their the challenge is greater as in a typical quenching it is possible to bend or warp the blade if it is not introduced to the quenchant smoothly and given the greater length of a sword over a knife there are more opportunities for flaws and mistakes to further there is a great deal of art and craft in arriving at a balance of hardness and strength and creating blades which consistently deliver swords could also be differentially hardened so that some like the cutting are harder than the creating and maintaining an appropriate edge

the cutting component of the the sharpness of a and ability to keep that is a balance between the volume of material supporting the edge and the thinness of the cutting edge while taking into account the chemical composition of the generally of which the blade is an ideal sharpness involves metal that tapers to a thickness measured in molecular widths with that provides strength without as

fashioning the sheath and other and in any fine once the blade had been heat a sword would be ground with progressively finer abrasives until the desired finish was it would then be as was mentioned

share some words and similar grammatical a study published in suggests romani is also related to journal divergence times support the anatolian theory of origin presently spoken in in terms of its grammatical romani is conservative in maintaining almost intact the middle person concord and in maintaining consonantal endings for nominal case both features that have been eroded in most other modern languages of central it shares an innovative pattern of person concord with the languages of the such as kashmiri and this is believed to be further proof that romani originated in the central then migrated to the characteristic for romani is the fusion of postpositions of the second layer case marking to the nominal and the emergence of external tense morphology that attaches to the person all of these features are shared between romani and which has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two the romani language is sometimes considered a group of dialects or a collection of related languages that comprise all the members of a single genetic while the language is nowhere there are attempts currently aimed at the creation of a standard language out of all variants as those from the different variants of the language are now in the process of being codified in those countries with high roma populations there are no sure historical documents about the early phases of the romani the language is not directly cited in the epic by the century poet who wrote about the or musicians who were given in the century ad by king of to the many have suggested that these people are the ancestors of the research carried out already in the nineteenth century by pott and miklosich showed this to be the romani language proves to be a new language not a as it would have to be to fit the principal argument favouring a migration during or after the transition period to nia is the loss of the old system of nominal and its reduction to just a case nominative a secondary argument concerns the system of gender romani has only two and middle languages generally had three genders feminine and and some modern languages retain this old system even it is argued that loss of the neuter gender did not occur until the transition to most of the neuter nouns became masculine while a few like the neuter in the became the feminine in and in the parallels in grammatical gender evolution between romani and other nia languages have been cited as evidence that the forerunner of romani remained in the indian subcontinent until a later perhaps even as late as the tenth century there are no historical proofs to clarify who were the ancestors of the and what motivated them to emigrate from the but there are various the influence of the to a lesser extent of

other groups of dialects were primarily based on geographical and vocabulary in the past several some scholars have worked out a categorisation of romani dialects from a linguistic point of view on the basis of historical evolution and much of this work was carried out by linguist norbert who pioneered the systematic plotting of structural features of romani dialects onto geographical this culminated in an atlas of romani with birgit which appeared in and plots numerous isoglosses onto at the university of similar work has been carried out by linguist and former activist yaron and his

romani matras has argued for a theory of geographical classification of romani which is based on the diffusion in space of according to this early romani spoken in the byzantine was brought to western and other parts of europe through population migrations of rom in the these groups settled in the various european regions during the and acquiring fluency in a variety of contact changes emerged which spread in creating the dialect differences attested according to there were two major centres of some changes emerged in western europe and spreading other emerged in the wallachian spreading to

described in during the summer of in march it returned as a major epidemic and was the object of extensive media retrospective studies have suggested that a case of ts might have occurred on a shrimp farm in as early as and that the virus was already present in ecuador in between and the disease spread to all major regions of the americas where is it has been estimated that the economic impact of ts in the americas during that time might have exceeded billion us the ecuadorian ts epidemic occurred concurrently with an outbreak of in the outbreak of black leaf disease led to an increase in fungicide usage within the taura river basin district near the city of it was thought that the antifungicide and used to control black ran off into nearby ponds and were responsible for analytical data demonstrated propiconazole in sediments and tissues of shrimp harvested from ts affected farms in no other pesticides were an ecuadorian shrimp farmer industry representative reported to the latest research it seems to us that this delicate balance was lost with the growth of the banana industry and the measures taken in that sector to overcome sigatoka black leaf spot with the application of a critical mass of toxic substances was producing taura other articles in the popular press described the toxic etiology of the disease in his wigglesworth mentions anomalies of the ts behavior with regard to a possible toxic etiology including higher resistance of wild to the the toxic etiology belief was strengthened by research performed by intriago et and other this was responsible for a controversy that lasted several years and might have contributed to the spread of the in january at the request of a ts workshop was held at the aquaculture pathology of the university of experts from seven countries with expertise in shrimp and insect shrimp water quality and farm management participated in the industry representatives from belgium and the usa also the group developed recommendations as to the standardization of the research on ts and suggested that studies be done to evaluate whether fungicide or an unrecognized agent was responsible for the james brock first demonstrated the infectious etiology of the disease by feeding taura victims to test the dying test shrimp were then fed to a new set of shrimp who was dying at the same precluding dilution of a toxic chemicals and suggesting the active replication of an infectious agent within the hasson et fulfilled the postulates and proved the viral etiology of the the basis for histopathological diagnosis of the disease was described by lightner et and several diagnostic methods were later the causative taura syndrome virus of the disease has been designated has a notifiable disease by the office international des reflecting the serious and devastating impacts of the the causal agent is referred by the name of infectious cuticular epithelial necrosis virus by some the causative agent of the has been isolated and based on biological and physical it was first classified as a possible member of the family it was later reclassified in the genus it currently belongs to that same but it is unassigned to any tsv is a particle with an morphology and a of web title taura syndrome virus fact sheet url publisher gulf states marine fisheries commission accessdate using light microscopic in situ hybridization it was found that the binding of the probe was limited to the cytoplasm of infected with no detectable signal within the nucleus et srisuvan et used electron microscopic in situ hybridisation to evaluate the replication of the virus within the they found that replicating tsv was associated with membranous structures within the they observed eccentricity of the nuclei of infected suggesting that tsv replication could take place in a defined region of the in that study the nuclei were relatively free of hybridization but a positive reaction was evident between the inner and outer nuclear membranes tsv has a genome that consists of the there is a nucleotides untranslated region at the end followed by two separated by an intergenic region of has motifs characteristic of a a an and a region of striking similarity with the baculovirus iap repeat domain at the the proteins and were mapped in alongside a minor protein of it has been hypothesized that the minor protein is produced by different proteolytic cleavage of the capsid polyprotein and could be a precursor for other capsid proteins the region separating the two orfs contains an that directs the synthesis of the capsid using analysis et suggested that although the of tsv contained more than orf the entire genome was transcribed as a single the capsid protein gene not being transcribed as despite reports by that certain primate cell lines could be used to culture pantoja et and luo et demonstrated that their report was based on misinterpretated at the present there is no continuous cell line that supports the growth of all virus amplifications require the use of live rna viruses such as tsv have rates of in the order of to per incorporated these very high rates might be due to the lack of proofreading function of the rna polymerase and have resulted in the emergence of new genetic variants of the direct analysis of genetic variations has revealed initially and later clusters of geographic isolates four genetic clusters are currently asia and according to their mortality rate and reaction with available five variants of the virus are isolates representing what are essentially clusters of tsv genotypes and the year of collection and hereafter referred to in this review as and the emergence of new strains could be caused by the rapid adaptation of the virus to new local environmental conditions following this produces adapted local substrains which facilitate infection of new resulting in the propagation of the new it has been suggested that new strains such as could have had evolved as a result of its infection of penaeus a new penaeid host for species currently considered to be tsv tolerant might be at risk following the introduction of tsv into new in tsv proteins might provide specific isolate with selective advantages such as increased or increased replication tang and lightner noted that even small variations in the tsv can result in substantial differences in infected with one isolate of isolated from captured from southern taiwan coastal showed no signs of active replication while another tsv isolate from isolated from a single was found to replicate freely within the shrimp three variants were tentatively attributed to serotype according to their reaction with the then sole available monoclonal antibody serotype serotype sinaloa and serotype out of the belize strain has consistently given higher mortality in bioassays and it is considered the most all tsv variants are similar in shape and size with light the average size of virus particles is compared to with a size of the region of highest genetic difference is within with pairwise comparison of nucleotide showing a to difference amongst isolates while the difference for is to tang et reported up to difference in using a larger group of isolates collected over a longer time span vs year for et the most variations in occur at the this may be because it is less constrained by structural requirements and more exposed than other regions of the tsv has been reported from virtually all regions of the americas including el costa venezuela as well as from the states of florida and south carolina web title taura syndrome virus of penaeid shrimp url publisher fisheries and oceans canada accessdate in the virus had spread to virtually all shrimp growing regions in the but had not yet been described in asia and other part of the until it was considered to be a western hemisphere the first asian outbreak occurred in it has more recently been identified in korea and indonesia where it has been associated with significant epizootics in farmed penaeus vannamei and the wide distribution of the disease has been attributed to the movement of host stocks for aquaculture this might have been helped by the highly stable nature of the it is thought that importation of vannamei from the western hemisphere was at the origin of the outbreak in this was further suggested by the genomic similarity of the taiwan and western hemisphere tsv appeared in thailand in due to the similarities in deduced protein sequence and the chronology of the disease outbreaks in relation to imported stocks it is likely that at least some of the thai isolates originated from chinese tsv is known to affect many penaeid shrimp it causes serious diseases in the postlarval juvenile and adult stages of penaeus the most susceptible target host with up to mortality in it also affects severely metapenaeus srisuvan et demonstrated the disease in a species previously thought to be other species such as chinensis present duorarum and japonicus have also been shown to be hosts for tsv in natural and experimental aztecus and duorarum were relatively tolerant to the virus and were not killed by tsv infection has no known impact on nauplii through the early postlarval postlarval to adult sizes are susceptible to infection by tsv but seem to show increasing ts resistance with increase in size brock et the size of shrimp affected with ts in has been reported as ranging from to laboratory results failed to find significant differences supporting the hypothesis that vannamei increase its tolerance to tsv as it increases in size to up to lotz noted a consistent trend for larger shrimp to be more likely to succumb the discrepancy between these findings and what is commonly observed in the field might be due to the larger shrimp being more likely to have previously been exposed and therefore having acquired the likelihood of infection and mortality from tsv is also dependent on the initial for both per os and water route of transmission the dose of tsv per g of shrimp will decrease as the shrimp increase in size there is variation within species and strains of shrimp have been developed et wild stocks are showing increased perhaps through intense natural selection lightner et lightner reports of ts in the wild are but in february the mexican fisheries ministry reported the presence of tsv in shrimp captured on the border of mexico and guatemala in and investigators have also reported the occurrence of ts in wild from the gulf of ecuador during and in adult vannamei collected from the pacific coast of honduras and el salvador in lightner et there are no confirmed reports indicating that tsv is infectious to other groups of decapod or crustaceans as a rna tsv has shown rapid sequence this could be related to adaptation to new according to phalitakul et the sequence divergence of an isolate of tsv from thailand suggested adaptation to monodon as a new host adaptation of the virus to new host has also been suggested in the case of stylirostris and et et in farm ts often causes high mortality during the first days of stocking into shrimp ponds the course of infection may be acute to chronic than at the pond level et the disease has three distinct but overlapping transition and the disease cycle has been characterized in detail in penaeus lotz et have developed mathematical model for epidemics of tsv in closed this model included the three phases described previously into five uninfected prepatently acutely chronically infected and dead infected after the initial infection the acute phase clinical signs can occur as early as hours in some individuals et and last for about days et infected shrimp display lethargy and erratic swimming they also present opacification of the tail soft cuticle in naturally occurring a red tail due to the expansion of chromatophores et focal necrosis of the tail cuticular epithelium can be seen with a hand lens flegel mortality during this phase can as high as the acute phase is characterized histologically by multifocal areas of nuclear and numerous cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the cuticular epithelium and the subcutis of the general body all esophagus and stomach et hasson et the pyknosis and karyorrhexis give a appearance to the tissue and are considered pathognomonic for the disease et in severe infections the antennal gland tubule the hematopoietic tissues and the testis are also affected et lightner et this occurs mainly in severe infection following injection of viral particles and has not been reported from naturally infected vannamei et evaluation of affected cells has allowed the observation of the inclusion bodies occupying a large area within the cytoplasm of infected the inclusion bodies are composed of an matrix reacting with tsv by ish using tsv specific cdna in early tem it was found that the inclusion bodies often contained crystals that were presumed to be made of and associated to a disruption of the calcium metabolism and the calcification process of the it has later been stated that these crystalline deposits were a variable finding that could reflect an artefact from the use of phosphate buffered glutaraldehyde fixation in brock et shrimp that survive the acute stage enter a transitional stage and show randomly distributed melanized lesions within of the cuticle of the cepahlothorax and tail region et these foci are the sites of acute lesions which have progressed onto subsequent stages of hemocytic cuticular epithelium regeneration and healing and which might be secondarily infected with bacteria et these foci are negative for tsv by ish et shrimp in the transition phase are lethargic and possibly because of the redirection of all their resources toward wound repair and recovery et histologically these shrimp present focal active acute lesions and the onset of lymphoid organ spheroids by ish with tsv specific probes a diffuse positive signal can be observed within the walls of lo of normal appearance with or without focal probe signals within developing los et if the shrimp undergo another successful moult following the transitional phase they will cast off the melanized lesions et and enter the chronic the chronic phase is first seen days and can persist for an undetermined period of at least months under experimental conditions et poulos et the chronic phase is characterized histologically by the absence of acute lesions and the presence of los of successive morphologies et these los are positive by ish for tsv et a low prevalence of ectopic spheroids can also be observed in some cases et los are not by themselves characteristic of tsv infection and can be found in other viral diseases of shrimp such as lymphoid organ vacuolization virus lymphoid virus lymphoid organ virus rhabdovirus of penaeid shrimp and yellow head virus et diagnosis of the disease during the chronic phase is problematic as shrimp do not display any outward signs of the disease and do not show mortality from the infection et hasson et it has been suggested that shrimp with chronic tsv infection were not as vigorous as uninfected as demonstrated by their inability to tolerate a salinity drop as well as uninfected shrimp et little is known regarding the effect of the virus at the cellular type receptor has been proposed as a putative attachment site for the virus and phongdara cevallos and sarnow have hypothesized that the virus might counteract phosphorylation of by kinase of the innate immune system by initiating translation without requirement for they also suggested the alternative hypothesis that the replication of the virus on cellular membranes may cause stress resulting in the activation of kinase and an overall inhibition of viral particles have been detected in the hemolymph of infected shrimp et these had the same morphology as virus purified from this indicates the systemic nature of the acute phase infection and that the whole virion is transported by the the expression of protein in the hemocytes of acutely infected shrimp has been evaluated using gel it showed that forms of eight proteins were significantly up regulated whereas nine forms of five proteins that were down the up regulated proteins were zeta tubulin protein disulfide isomerase carboxylesterase and one unknown the down regulated proteins were the light chain of glutathione transferase and only hemocyanin fragments c or n were not the these fragments could have a functional significance during the molecular response of shrimp hemocytes to ts et the most likely route for transmission of tsv is cannibalism of dead infected the virus can be spread from one farm to another by seagulls and aquatic such as the water trichocorixa reticulata and redman shrimp farmers from honduras and columbia have reported numbers of these insects in ponds by hasson et ish assays run on histological sections of water boatman collected from ponds in which severe ts outbreaks were showed several individuals with tsv positive gut there no indication that the virus was infecting or replicating in the insect et al infectious tsv has been found in the feces of laughing larus that fed on infected shrimp during an epizootic in texas et controlled laboratory studies have documented that tsv remains infectious for up to one day after passage through the gut of white leghorns gallus and laughing gulls et vertical transmission of tsv is thought to occur based on anecdotal but this has not been experimentally confirmed and redman dhar et shrimp surviving an outbreak of tsv seem to be refractory to reinfection hasson reported by anon albeit remain carriers and are source for infection of susceptible animals et it has been hypothesized that tsv was introduced to southeast asia with chronically infected shrimp imported from the western hemisphere and song the ability of tsv to remain at least partly infectious after one or several cycles might be a contributing factor facilitating its spread in the international commerce of frozen commodity products tsv is however easily degraded by multiple cycles when in purified or form et mechanisms by which infected frozen shrimp could spread the virus reprocessing of shrimp at processing plants with release of infectious liquid disposal of solid wastes in landfills where seagulls could acquire the virus and then spread the use of shrimp as bait by sport fishermen and the use of imported shrimp as fresh food for other aquatic species et the latter was practiced at the national zoo in washington when freshwater crayfish became infected with another exotic virus of shrimp white spot syndrome virus in lightner et the importation of infected commodity shrimp might therefore present a risk of accidental contamination of wild and cultured stocks et al the disease has potential to become established in wild stock and its effects on commercial penaeid fisheries or on the culture of native species are unknown et flegel ts can spread rapidly when introduced in news a shrimp farmer described the outbreak in texas as this thing spread like a forest there was not stopping i just sat there and watched and in a matter of three my shrimp were in rosenberry a presumptive diagnosis of acute tsv infection can be established by the presence of dead or dying shrimp in used for routine are attracted to diseased ponds and feed heavily on the dying contributing to the dispersion of the disease throughout a farm or a shrimp farming the unique signs of infection caused by ts such as the cuticular melanized spots can provide a strong but care must be taken as these can be confused with other diseases such as in general histopathological lesions are the first step in discrete foci of pyknotic and karyorhectic nuclei and inflammation are seen within the cuticular the lymphoid organ might display but is otherwise the genome of the virus has been cloned and specific are available for diagnosis ish analysis of acute phase lesions has demonstrated that gene probe positive signals are strongest within intact cells in the early stages of it is believed following cell the virus is rapidly dispersed by the resulting in a weakly positive to negative probe signal to the remaining cellular or nuclear reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods have been developed for detection of tsv and have a detection limit of of using either a or has a lower detection limit of of rna techniques allow for quantification of the reverse transcription isothermal amplification has been this method is performed under isothermal requiring only a simple water another method requiring only a simple heating is the coupled with a colorimetric described by teng et multiplex for simultaneous detection of wssv and tsv have been described et xie et have developed a multiplex that allows for the detection of three viral wssv and infectious hypodermal and hemapoietic necrosis virus a nested based technique is commercially the tsv detection and prevention system is said to have a detection limit of copies per reaction methods are specific and sensitive and have proven to be very helpful in research and as diagnostic they are relatively expensive to perform and require specific equipment and highly trained they are also limited by the relative fragility of the viral prolonged fixation in fixative might result in rna degradation due to acid hydrolysis et lien et the complexity of these approaches has limited their practical applications et an alternative for virus detection is the utilization of specific monoclonal directed against the relatively stable proteins in the viral because of their versatility and reasonably good sensitivity tests could be potentially very useful as routine diagnostic test for the screening of a large number of samples at a relatively low cost and with minimum requirement of technical expertise et such rapid diagnostic tests are now in common use for wssv and are being marketed under the commercial name of similar tests for yellow head virus and ihhnv are currently under these tests are based on the principle of the sandwich no special tissue preparation is required and results can be obtained readily et polyclonal antibodies against tsv have been made et chaivisuthangkura et and rabbit pabs are commercially available polyclonal antibodies react with a wide range of epitopes and do not present the reactional stability of pabs also require a constant use of whether rabbits or with possible monoclonal antibodies against tsv have been developed et however they do not recognize three of the five recognized strains of the and et erickson et cote et this there is a definite need to produce monoclonal antibodies against these which could be used in rapid diagnostic tests and other assays for virus characterization et monoclonal antibodies recognising the more conserved have been developed et targeting this protein could prove to be an interesting avenue for prior et have developed a controlled bioassay system for the determination of lethal infective dose of tissue homogenate containing their bioassay system uses individual flasks to house tsv challenged indicator shrimp to eliminate the possibility of viral dose magnification during the challenge due to cannibalism or the shedding of infectious particles in the water by infected management strategies for the disease have included raising more resistant species such as penaeus stylirostris and stocking of specific pathogen free or specific pathogen resistant shrimp and redman relatively simple laboratory challenges can be used to predict the performance of selected stocks in farm where tsv is enzootic et wyban et shrimp are susceptible to infection but have high survival following challenge with at least four variants of tsv et in challenge assays there was no significant difference between the survival of the author stated that resistant lines have reached nearly complete resistance to and th and further improvement due to breeding for should be minor et significant improvements in tsv survival were made through selective breeding despite low to moderate heritability for this trait et a management strategy used to reduce the impact of ts has been the practice of stocking pls at increased stocking density following this farms would experience mortality due to ts at an early stage of the production before substantial feeding had and the surviving shrimp would be resistant to further tsv challenges and redman other techniques used with limited efficacy have been the polyculture of shrimp with tilapia and maintenance of near optimal water quality conditions in the ponds with reduction of organic loading brock transgenic shrimp expressing an antisense tsv coat protein exhibited increased survival in tsv challenges and sun the public perception of transgenic animals as well as current technical limit the use of transgenic animals as a mean of disease control there is one instance where tsv was successfully eradicated from one shrimp farming country this required strict disinfection and quarantine protocols and was helped by the relative isolation and the relatively small size of the belize shrimp farming industry and dorado tsv has since reappeared in belize and eradication is now not considered a viable option for control of the rather control by using shrimp stocks et argue et the virus has been eradicated from the hawaii islands and has not been detected in hawaii during the period from to et a case of tsv occurred in one hawaiian farm and was confirmed

is a created by harrison gough and currently published by consulting psychologists it was created in a similar manner to the but unlike the it is not concerned with maladjustment or clinical but concerned itself with more aspects of testing and new and the cpi is made up of half of which were taken from the original version of the the test is scored on three of which are eleven of the scales were selected by comparing responses from various groups of the other four were content the test is typically used with people aged years and it takes about minutes to the revised third edition of the cpi contains this latest version requires that the false and true answers be transformed at an additional cost into raw scale and standard scores by the who will also provide interpretative report the older cpi with the items is still available for sale by the consulting psychologists and comes with plastic scoring keys and profile thus allowing each research or clinical psychologist to score the test by an admittedly less convenient but nonetheless a less expensive one ideally suited for use in training psychology california psychological inventory palo consulting psychologists the inventory contains items which can be scored to yield the scales are further grouped into four of and interpersonal measures of intrapersonal and measures of achievement potential and intellectual measures of intellectual modes and interest palo consulting psychologists this paragraph will discuss what are referred to as the structural scales of the using information being provided by the manual for that the cpi guide from california psychological inventory palo consulting psychologists delta and gamma personality types are conveniently illustrated by a placement on a grid defined by the two dimensions the degree to which the person is or on one dimension the and the degree to which he or she is more externally or internally focused alpha personality types are more dependable and betas are responsible and gammas are and deltas are and to some extent in a separate measure known as also referred to as the a score may reflect the degree to which he or she is and optimistic about the present and when the score is or possesses the opposite characteristics when research scientists or medical or psychology graduate students tend to score high on this while psychiatric juvenile prison inmates and even high school students in general lack life experience and are still forging a solid sense of tend to score another component of this test are the folk concept scales in the measuring capacity for social good achievement via achievement via intellectual and these scales are called as they attempt to capture personality themes that should be broadly and easily understood around the this test is thus an attempt to tap into personality factors that arise without exception to in all humans regardless of cultural and which provide a picture of relatively stable tendencies and which is as good as any definition for what is loosely termed their unique correlations between cpi scales and related external criteria tend to fall in the to this degree of correlation is typical for much of personality extremely high correlations are not likely to be found for personality measures because the scales typically try to assess rather broad behavioral norms are available for males females and data the cpi has been very popular in research and in individual assessments of adolescents and the fact that it was developed and normed on or populations is regarded almost universally as part of its positive reputation and usefulness among character yoichi asakawa to close family members in and yoichi fans his pet name is yoichi born is the son of and he lives with his mother in a small flat in his parents divorced when he was young it is and he has very little contact with his if he was very close to his cousin tomoko daughter of his elder sister and was badly affected by her yoichi is very independent and quiet for a boy of his without a male he has made himself man of the house and takes it in his stride to help look after his he tries to support her by helping he lays out a change of clothes for her when she comes home from walks to school alone and prepares his own the only person he seems to have a close relationship with is his maternal koichi with who he acts like a normal yoichi is very similar to his father in behaviour and both are aloof and suppress their despite their they appear to have special in which they can sense when they are both in he clearly loves both his as demonstrated in but his relationship to both of them is also on a level he is able to see his cousin tomoko who tells him to watch the cursed vidoetape that his parents are after yoichi watches the videotape his parents begin to force themselves further to try and find a way to save they leave yoichi with his grandfather and learn more about the they discover its origin and its upon finding her body and laying it to reiko die and they believe she is following the events they have been a reconciliation between parents seems likely as reiko and ryuji appear ready to try again at being a the hope amounts to nothing as ryuji dies the next day at his reiko realizes the help of that the way to save yourself is to copy the tape and show it to someone she travels to her house and yoichi does the same thing as his mother giving his grandfather the in the of the asakawa family and seem to each have a certain amount of or ryuji and reiko have both demonstrated signs that they can sense s when they are in the same powers go beyond this as he can see and even speak to this suggests that the abilities esp can bring are and the genes carrying the dna so the strength of the two parents together becomes the amount of power the child another interesting point about the powers is that they each seem to have a if one family member is in the other two family members automatically know this unfortunately aides them as well as it possibly whether these feelings are down to or simple between yoichi and his parents is but due to the nature of and the lack of personal connection there was before the events of the argument for clairsentience is evidence for and in the family is used several times during as the result of his yoichi is rendered unable to the powers he demonstrates are rooted to his feelings for his both deceased by the end of the his used of powers take a less realistic effect that the first film yoichi is saved in when his father appeared and took his fear of sadako away from yoichi was reluctant to hand over his fear to his possibly because he knew power might harm his though the reasons for the dissolution of ryuji and marriage are never yoichi and ryuji appear to hold a close bound with his as her feelings for while also on a clairsentience were mainly in yoichi appears to also resemble his father in other ways his personality is similar as both characters are and emotional vacuums most of the the nature of his inner powers resemble rather than and like his father he received headaches from being close to supernatural the feelings they both have for each other also appear tarnished as the problems yoichi faces in are rooted back to the death of his ryuji is also seems to feel the need to look out for during the first film he asks after him to reiko and asks if be okay being left alone to which reiko replies used to depending on which sequel viewing the relationship from or many people have different ideas of the feelings yoichi and ryuji have for each while others say they have little as they rarely see each others claim that the likeness between them and concern ryuji shows for yoichi proves that he deeply cares for if not loves yoichi on the other seems to be devoted to both of his parents regardless of their faults and the lack of emotional connection he has with xaver von was an important catholic

to do for comic opera what wagner has done for grand opera by combining words and music so as to make them walbrook similarly wrote in gilbert and sullivan biographer michael writing in after the premiere of the explained its enduring could be more serious than a court of now the world had been turned upside the court of law had become the scene of humor and the learned judge had shown himself to be as fickle as the and the justice system turned out to be flawed by human and sullivan had grasped the from the first music sets the scene of and proceeds to dance its way through the whole as the first by marked an important moment in the history of the gilbert and sullivan as well as in the careers of each of the two men and in victorian drama in historian reginald allen sums up the historical import of the sidney dark and rowland grey also give a high value to the importance of by and the operas that is not a little historical interest in the genesis of the gilbert and sullivan

later gilbert and sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in for all except for begin with a chorus like by the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal the broken of was the first in a string of meditative happiness and an acceptance and a smiling these from this point allow the in each of the savoy an introspective scene where they stop and consider in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding like both of the arias in by tenor arias in later savoy operas were set in so frequently

that led to his becoming a and would set the pattern for many of the patter songs in gilbert and sullivan operas to one of most notable first found in and repeated in by and all of the later savoy is the use of the chorus as an essential part of the in most earlier and the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as or in the gilbert and sullivan the chorus is taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own sullivan gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage it was in that gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the at this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience at that a tremendous another gilbert following the example of his was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as gilbert based the scenery for the production on the sessions where he had practiced law in the the costumes were and angelina and her bridesmaids were dressed in real wedding this attention to detail and careful creation of realistic sets and scenes were typical of stage management and would be repeated in all of for when preparing the sets for gilbert and sullivan visited to inspect gilbert made sketches of the and the and created a model set for the carpenters to work this was far from standard procedure in victorian where naturalism was still a relatively new and where most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were andrew crowther places by at the centre of development as a he notes that in some of early such as the songs simply emphasise the in such as some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and such as once knew a or maid of which simply convey a moral in by each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the in unlike some of more fantastical early from the nothing

computer program used in the prius shuts off the engine when the car is is or is descending thereby dramatically decreasing fuel consumption in city driving the computer program determines when and how to use the or both to power the car and recharge the battery so as to maximize a gasoline engine runs inefficiently at creating a choking condition called a major reason for the inefficiency of gasoline engines compared to the prius minimizes pumping loss by using a high torque range as much as possible with the throttle fully throttle control technology and torque electric and computer are essential to this engine in addition to the immediate benefit of reducing fuel consumption and stopping the gasoline engine also improves the performance of the catalytic as the exhaust gases from an idling engine tend to cool the catalyst below its optimal typical or vehicles consume fuel when the vehicle is as is common in city the prius typically shuts down the gasoline engine and runs solely off the battery pack at low speeds and when a car also gets worse fuel consumption in city driving because its engine is continually used to accelerate the car to driving speed and then this energy is lost to friction brakes during the prius recaptures some of this energy by using regenerative braking to charge its battery pack while slowing down with its in generator for acceptable acceleration the ic engine on a car typically is much larger than needed for by using both a gasoline engine and electric motors for acceleration the prius engine can be a smaller size and still provide acceptable this means the greatest advantages of a hybrid are mainly in city though factors including driving air conditioning and short trips may offset some of this the frequent starting and stopping of the prius engine does not cause noticeable additional wear and tear or emission problems because the electric drive motors have enough power to quickly spin the engine to optimal speed before fuel is for any which vary roughly as the velocity squared due to air are much greater on the highway than in low speed city the prius hybrid has less of an advantage in higher speed open road typical of

they massacred two families of settlers along the hawkins demanded that the creek turn over little warrior and his six instead of handing the marauders over to the federal the old chiefs decided to execute the murderers this decision was the spark which ignited the civil war between the the creeks from the upper towns immediately conquered several lower towns within the creek the lower towns had taken conscious steps to assimilate themselves into culture by raising domesticated and using spinning the red sticks destroyed everything that they perceived to have come from the white such as the domesticated pots and and homespun the red sticks were not above confiscating the guns and steel blades that they the first clashes between red sticks and the american whites took place when a group

about miles from the nearest supply point available to any of the three american the easiest attack route was from georgia through the line of forts on the frontier and then along a good road that led to the upper creek towns near the holy another route was north from mobile along the alabama the most route of was south from tennessee through a mountainous and pathless although mission was to

one which changes with if it changes the response may be determined with static but if it varies quickly to the ability to the response must be determined with a dynamic dynamic analysis for simple structures can be carried out but for complex structures can be used to calculate the mode shapes and a dynamic load can have a significantly larger effect than a static load of the same magnitude due to the inability to respond quickly to the loading the increase in the effect of a dynamic load is given by the where u is the deflection of the structure due to the graphs of dynamic amplification factors vs exist for standard loading functions an explanation of rise see history hence the daf for a given loading can be read from the the static deflection can be easily calculated for simple structures and the dynamic deflection a full time history will give the response of a structure over time during and after the application of a to find the full time history of a response you must solve the a simple single on a of k for has the following equation of where is the acceleration double of the and x is the if the loading is a sudden application of a constant the solution to the equation of motion where and the fundamental natural the static deflection of a single degree of freedom system so you can by combining the above this gives the time history of the structure due to a load where the false assumption is made that there is no although this is too simplistic to apply to a real the heaviside step function is a reasonable model for the application of many real such as

natural frequency of a system is dependent only on the of the structure and the which participates with the structure it is not dependent on the load it is useful to know the modal frequencies of a structure as it allows you to ensure that the frequency of any applied periodic loading will not coincide with a modal frequency and hence cause which leads to large the method find the natural modes shape adopted by a and natural frequencies calculate the response of each mode optionally superpose the response of each mode to find the full modal response to a given loading it is possible to calculate the frequency of different mode shapes of system manually by the for a given mode shape of a multiple degree of freedom system you can find an stiffness and applied force for a single degree

of several vhf television stations affiliated with major primarily the major impetus for the changes was to improve local coverage of the fledgling new as a result of various other deals that followed as a result of the affiliation most notably the buyout of cbs by the switches constituted some of the most sweeping changes in for some chief executive officer of the parent company of the fox lusted after a sports presence for his he thought that landing a live sports broadcasting package would elevate fox to the level of and the other nationwide broadcast networks in the united states at the in the network bid for then the but the offer was fox stunned the sports and tv worlds by acquiring partial rights to the the package covering four seasons of games involving teams in the as well as several a package previously owned by cbs cost fox then run by the had reportedly bid only million and was unwilling to even approach the fox at the time of most of its affiliates were as fox put together its new sports division to cover the it wanted to affiliate with stations that had lower channel numbers to more established and carried more value with in the spring of months after completing the nfl fox agreed to purchase a percent stake in new world communications in a the following stations were part of the in two citicasters and were left out of the new world both would later be sold to wkrc is owned by which on bought the television division of had purchased jacor back in wtsp is owned by neither station would have been of any benefit to in the aired on nbc and at the the games now air on and in new world already owned which was the of the two stations at the not all the stations involved would switch to the key to the deal was that fox upgraded its affiliate stations in several before the of the nfc teams at the only four had vhf fox the and all were fox stations with the exception of the san francisco which remains the largest fox affiliate not owned by the network to this most of the stations involved in the new world deal were located in markets with teams from the considered the more prestigious of the two nfl conferences for two the teams in the nfc were located in nine of the ten largest television markets at the the lone exception being whose only nfl the plays in the many of the nfc teams have existed before the formation of the old and therefore contain longer rivalries and at the time the nfc was considered the conference of the two and was in the midst of a winning streak against the afc in the many of the stations in affected markets were former affiliates from which fox won the nfc thus fans would continue to see at least their road games on local vhf teams in markets related to ktbc and witi served markets containing significant fan bases for nearby nfc ktbc served the area and had aired cowboys games for years during while witi had broadcast packers games to its audience since becoming a cbs affiliate in in a year after the fox louis received an nfc when the rams moved this made the eighth station sixth in an nfc among the stations involved in the bringing the total number of nfc teams with vhf fox affiliates to that same the joined the nfl as an expansion which made another satellite station for an nfl team as the panthers are based in which is directly south of the region where wghp is just weeks after completing the new world fox announced another this one of burnham the stations involved fox would own the stations in conjunction with savoy a communications the deal gave fox upgrades for the home markets of two more the packers and the giving fox vhf affiliates in eleven of the fifteen nfc the landscape of local television in many areas changed as viewers got used to new the transition was straightforward in some as kansas cleveland and the saw the old fox affiliates simply swap with the new replaced wdaf as kansas nbc while and affiliated with abc in louis and the piedmont in austin and in cleveland affiliated with all five were uhf the largest affiliation swap occurred in central including the where six different stations changed affiliations due to wbrc moving from abc to and the cbs affiliates for and merged and became the combined abc affiliate for birmingham and central the former fox affiliate for became the cbs affiliate for northeast alabama before eventually becoming the network affiliate for and the fox affiliates for birmingham and became independent stations before eventually affiliating with the as cbs bore the worst brunt of the the network had already developed a stodgy image under its and saw its ratings slip following the when it lost the nfl to the problems accelerated as cbs struggled to compete with nbc and abc in the even though the network still finished ahead of cbs eventually recovered and by was the network until it was surpassed by abc in and nbc in before retaking the lead again in as most watched a title it continues to hold to this problems were especially evident in the recruiting of new only four new cbs affiliates were vhf in the became the new cbs affiliate after switched to the former fox in the became a wb and is now affiliated with the cbs also gained a new vhf affiliation in after cbs moved to former independent station ironically was original phoenix owned by the as part of the kpho cbs wanted an nbc to be a cbs affiliate instead of in the michigan became an nbc affiliate as a as a of the ktvt another new vhf cbs affiliate at the time was then sister station in which replaced in that this affiliation only lasted two years as returned to cbs in following a sale of the station to both ktvt and kstw are now both owned by cbs reached new affiliation deals with displaced vhf abc affiliates wkrc in cincinnati and wtsp in tampa the affiliate switches also led to another deal involving the parent company of two in cleveland and in detroit latter of which was previously by the network until the buyout of abc in were being courted by cbs to replace wjw and in order to keep abc on wews and scripps required abc to switch its affiliations to four of the these stations were in in in and in the latter two of which were also slated to lose fox due to the new world this deal stripped wkrc in cincinnati and wtsp in the two citicasters stations not involved in the new world of their abc along with in which ended up becoming an independent but the switchovers especially upset the owners of longtime affiliate in which had been the abc affiliate in the nation at the westinghouse eventually sought an affiliation deal of its and in the company agreed to affiliate its entire broadcast station fleet with two of which in and in were already affiliated with the in kpix and both of whom along the rest of the westinghouse stations were known for some network began carrying the entire cbs schedule as a condition of the this was followed by and nbc affiliate switching to cbs at the end of and then the switchover before the beginning of the television season of in from nbc to whom westinghouse also sold a minority share of the various deals following the new world announcement left cbs with a slew of especially in and where the new affiliates were all uhf stations with far less transmitting power than their previous the primary plus for the new fox stations collectively was an increase in the amount of news covered on these which fox had high interest in doing as the network had still to this day no national over the former big three stations which had aired newscasts for years expanded them along with many original fox morning newscasts on fox stations gradually expanded to compete with the national morning shows aired by the big new fox affiliates saw mixed results with their some of the new fox perhaps in appealing to moved many older news personalities to daytime broadcasts or released them entirely from their news some of these personalities eventually wound up on other including the new big three many of the new big three affiliates were not as as these were former fox affiliates that did not have newscasts at the almost all of them had to give in to launching them to back up the newscasts provided by the the stations that continue to air newscasts to this day have finished in fourth place behind their vhf many of these such as and have seen gradual growth in their as have former affiliates and even and have seen yet all stations still rank fourth place on other new affiliates that launched newscasts experienced no permanent in premiered a newscast in fall produced by sister station both the wkbd and wwj newscasts were cancelled in late under an agreement made by to produce wwj is now the and the only of any major to have no from to began making light of this fact by using a no news is good for promoting programming during periods where there would usually be two abc in louis and in the piedmont triad also experienced news department lasted for six years until its which was widely blamed on a transmitter and is now the station in the louis behind cw affiliate current position as one of weakest perhaps the weakest among top markets stands in sharp contrast to which was one of strongest newscast was cancelled under orders of its owner its controversial due to poor wxlv also had run newscasts since becoming an abc affiliate until which was one of the few major markets not to see an affiliation switch besides airing the full slate of cbs programming due to the was not affected by the switch at saw fox affiliate start a pm newscast in likely in response to markets that were affected now having newscasts from all four while ratings were strong initially and only competed against the by which also owns nbc affiliate they declined sharply after kdka launched a pm newscast on sister station in which owns wpgh and sister station entered into a news share agreement with wpxi in and shut down news with pcnc now airing a newscast so that it compete with the newscast on ratings have since been more competitive in the pm when fox made the affiliation agreement with new all stations that switched to fox chose not to carry programming due to interest in airing more local which is uncharacteristic of a broadcast network big three affiliates are required to air their program block the big three only aired their shows on saturdays compared to fox and when new world was bought out by it became the first network which had that did not air all network one new world station eventually picked up fox ktvi initially rejected fox kids as did all of new stations that affiliated with but religious station owned by the new life christian chose to air ministry messages in place of commercials as the reverend larry refused to show commercials during fox kids fox was not pleased with controversial topics such as abortion being shown during fox kids which led fox to move fox kids to ktvi remains the only world station airing however the station airs it two hours earlier than other stations that carry due to a morning newscast airing at although five stations ktbc and had rejected fox kids programming its fox foxbox and none of them filled the timeslots with local news on instead filling the time with paid local home selling presentation and programming acquired via many stations that rejected fox kids passed it to another station in the typically an independent station or a smaller network this especially true following purchase of in however in four world markets tv does not air on another station in any of those markets due to stations dropping the in tv has aired on independent station a class a television since september though the station has extended cable coverage throughout the it is much less than former fox kids station at least three other stations of which are owned by have pulled such a wfld in one of the original fox dropped tv and moved it to sister station in kmsp also dropped tv in moving it to sister station in the in by moved tv to mynetworktv affiliate owned by the same in all three cases it was due to an expansion of their morning newscasts to saturday because these fox stations deny clearance of tv is merely a syndication despite fox continuing to advertise in promos airing during select fox primetime shows that tv programming is part of the if fox limited tv to air on fox stations affiliates could be given the choice to broadcast the lineup around local as the case is with abc and until such a thing all stations that do not air tv air syndicated educational programs that meet guidelines those seen on in its either following a newscast or in place of such as and so as to not violate regulations requiring commercial broadcasters to air a certain amount of programming educational and each fox continued to upgrade its stations in at least two unrelated deals struck at least one other station owner has pulled off a similar in moved the fox affiliation in the market from on uhf channel to on vhf channel kptv was a charter fox afiliate from meredith had just acquired kptv from in an ironic fox television stations group would later buy all the remaining which in would all join as part of the this makes for an indirect connection between the last two major changes in broadcast affiliate lineups in the on the other cbs saw an affiliate downgrade from vhf to uhf in an unrelated which occurred in the home of the in the most jaguars game are on in the summer of which owns terminated that longtime affiliation with cbs in a dispute over the new affiliate became which had been the local outlet of was then with wjxt broadcasts on channel wtev on channel the new upn affiliate became fox affiliate on a secondary both waws

many home team entertainment programs have also benefited from the heavy promotion they received during the some of the beneficiaries include shows already on fox at the such as as well as newer programs like and in has been the number one rated program on all networks the last three years and while cbs did eventually its recovery is partially linked reacquiring nfl rights in when it took over rights to the afc from the saw the an original afl defeat the in which aired on nbc and ended a drought against the nfc in the super around the time cbs took over the rights to the afc saw the trend of the and in that the afc became the dominant conference over the the dynasty in the in the only market also contributed to the ratings in the current afc deal also saw cbs indirectly acquire rights to air games played by the which air locally on was a cbs by the time nfl rights were reacquired and has long been one of strongest and often get the highest ratings for an nfl team on

brother of karun is playing cricket and studying at the university of i caught up with him to find out more about cricket in australia and whether big fame has affected mk a question that sure answered why not sc well i know its in my blood and i took to but i always drifted towards any cricket soon became a mk was there any pressure from family sc at in fact i think my really happy because i think probably be living on the streets if he had to fund another racing mk why australia it seems to be the trend to move out of the country now sc not sure about trends but i think it was always a dream for me to play cricket outside india and i was fortunate to be accepted by the team here and the i played a lot of cricket in madras but was often bogged down by the pressure and politics that surrounds the sport back mk what major changes have you seen here sc i think the way they approach the game is extremely everything is based on merit and not who you know and what string you can pull they put fitness first and also bring in the mental aspect of the which is very vital in the when it comes to coaching i think too i was fortunate to have extremely committed coaches in madras who laid the ideal foundation for me and taught me all that i mk do you see yourself playing professional cricket in a few years as sc i think with a year can change if you want something bad you can get i have my eyes set playing for a i am now playing grade cricket for the adelaide university cricket club with recognized state the likes of carl michael slater and more recently liam plunkett have played for the club and i hope to make it to the by the end of the i think i learnt from karun and lost after i got here which has definitely helped my i am going to pursue a sports management degree as well so whether i am playing or i know i will be in and around the sporting world mk sports does that mean you may opt to manage your sc why let him do the driving and just take care of the mk it like to be overshadowed by his sc i really think about it like if we were both racing then maybe so but on another we respect what each of us has from being a guy who weighed close to to who he is taken a leaf out of his mk do you think make it to sc well based on i would say yes but there are more important aspects that come into the finances have to come although narain has opened up the sport in the country i think the major corporates have climbed onto the bandwagon just i think karun has proved that when you put him in the car and under the he knows what he has to do and certainly gets the job mk what is the real karun outside the how does he spend his sc i think just like anyone he likes to hang out with his friends whenever he play with narain or stay at home and play his favourite pastime would definitely be talking to my dog they go at it for hours on we barely see him though because either at the gym or cycling to keep i think his key to success has been his dedication and although never had things come easy he has certainly proved a point to his critics this mk your mentor or idol and a message to others who are thinking about the shift to sc my mentor or idol would have to be my cricket coach in a gem of a person and has always supported me through everything i can still never tell when actually really as for anyone who is thinking about the land

model is a product of the oasis soa reference model technical committee oasis reference model for service oriented architecture prior to this no standard definition of soa had the tc was chartered in february to develop a core to guide and foster the creation of specific and to publish a reference model for as well as one or more reference architectures based on the reference why we need the oasis soa reference the reference model was approved as an oasis standard by oasis members in october oasis members approve soa reference while the oasis soa reference model has been welcomed in some considering the soa reference model part considering the soa reference model part there is some indication of rival initiatives by other standards including the open group debates soa reference psst got a soa reference want another at this the future work of the tc beyond the current specification has not yet been the subcommittee is continuing to developing an soa reference architecture based on the according to the soa is a for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership it provides a uniform means to interact with and use capabilities to produce desired effects consistent with measurable preconditions and the specification bases its definition of soa around the concept of and where soa provides a mechanism for matching needs of service consumers with capabilities provided by service the central concept of the reference model is that of which the reference model defines as a mechanism to enable access to one or more where the access is provided using a prescribed interface and is exercised consistent with constraints and policies as specified by the service the following are the principal concepts that the reference model defines around and real world effect address the dynamic aspects of services with while the remaining concepts address static the information needed in order to or consider a the purpose of description is to facilitate interaction and particularly when the participants are in different ownership between participants in service the capacity for those with needs and those with capabilities to be able to interact with each this is typically done by providing descriptions for such aspects as functions and technical related constraints and and mechanisms for access or refers to the interaction between service providers and typically mediated by the exchange of an interaction proceeds through a series of information exchanges and invoked the result of an interaction is a real world world the actual result of using a this may be the return of information or the change in the state of entities or that are involved in the the set of technical and business elements that form a path between those with needs and those with capabilities and that permit service providers and consumers to all interactions are grounded in a particular execution which permits service providers and consumers to interact and provides a decision point for any policies and contracts that may be in a policy represents some constraint or condition on the deployment or description of an owned entity as defined by any while a contract represents an agreement by two or more the reference model is focused primarily on the concept of policies and contracts as they apply to the following example is taken from the specification and includes the principal concepts described above as well as other concepts that the reference model in parentheses and an electric utility has the capacity to generate and distribute electricity underlying the wiring from the electric distribution grid provides the means to supply electricity to support typical usage for a residential house and a consumer accesses electricity generated output of invoking the via a wall outlet in order to use the a consumer needs to understand what type of plug to what is the voltage of the and possible limits to the the utility presumes that the customer will only connect devices that are compatible with the voltage provided and load and the consumer in turn assumes that compatible consumer devices can be connected without damage or harm technical a residential or business user will need to open an account with the utility in order to use the supply and the utility will meter usage and expects the consumer to pay for use at the rate prescribed when the consumer and utility agree on constraints and policies the consumer can receive electricity using the service as long as the electricity distribution grid and house connection remain intact a storm knocking down power lines would disrupt and the consumer can have payment sent a check by mail or electronic funds to the utility another person a visitor to someone may use a contracted supply without any relationship with the utility or any requirement to also satisfy the initial service constraint reachability only requires intact electricity but would nonetheless be expected to be compatible with the service in certain situations excessive a utility may limit supply or institute rolling blackouts a consumer might lodge a formal complaint if this occurred frequently implied if the utility required every device to be hardwired to its the underlying capability would still be there but this would be a very different service and have a very different service while the reference model incorporates the notion of processes through its process model the extent of this aspect of the reference model is intentionally not completely for the reference model does not address the orchestration of multiple although orchestration and choreography may be part of the process this is because the focus of the reference model is on modeling what services are and what key relationships are involved in modeling it is envisioned that there may be future work in this though the source of that work has yet to be according to the a reference model is an abstract framework for understanding significant relationships among the entities of some it enables the development of specific reference or concrete architectures using consistent standards or specifications supporting that a reference model consists of a minimal set of unifying axioms and relationships within a particular problem and is independent of specific or other concrete a reference model for is an abstract framework for understanding significant relationships among the entities of the specification provides a clear distinction between a reference model and a reference and describes the relationship between a reference architecture is an architectural design pattern that indicates how an abstract set of mechanisms and relationships realizes a predetermined set of one or more reference architectures may be derived from a common reference to address different to which the reference model may be the specification provides an analogy involving

ancient is a division used by some researchers in describing the in and human nervous the isothalamus constitutes or more of the and despite the variety of functions it follows a simple organizational the constituting neurons belong to two different neuronal the first correspond to the they have a as their arborisation is made up of straight dendritic distal branches starting from short and thick the number of branches and the diameter of the arborisation are linked to the specific system of which they are a part and to the animal they have the rather rare property of having no initial which implies that one emitting thalamocortical neuron does not send information to its they send rgic projections to the where they end electively at the layer iv the other genus is made up of these have short and thin dendrites and short and thus belong to local circuitry their percentage in comparison to thalamocortical neurons varies across highly increasing with their short axonal parts contact thalamocortical or other local circuitry their neurotransmitter is the dendrites of the two constituting genera receive s from a variety of afferent the connection back to the thalamocortical neurons create modulating the thalamocortical one subcortical afference comes from the perithalamus this receives axonal branches from thalamocortical its afferences are also the number of perithalamic neurons strongly decreases in evolution in opposition to the large increase in microneurons journal frassoni regondi de biasi spreafico r neurons in mammalian a marker of thalamic res bull to some extent the perithalamus plays a role in the local the circuitous connection with corticothalamic neurons participates in the elaboration of thalamic the different functional modalities represented in the thalamus are segregated in specific anatomical differentiated by the cerebral systems from where they receive their afferent there are more corticothalamic than thalamocortical corticothalamic endings are of two the projection emanates from layer vi of the axons are thin and have a almost trajectory through the not respecting intrathalamic they emit only short perpendicular collaterals arborization formin a thin cylinder and their terminal synapses are the second kind of corticothamic axons is the rockland type ii journal k evidence for two types of corticopulvinar neurons this emanates from larger pyramidal cells and is much its ending is dense and its synapses are located close to the soma of the thalamic often forming the center of glomerular the isothalamus serves the function of transforming and distributing information to the the thalamic parts delineated by the lamellar and cellular according to the founding system of burdach von baue und leben des constituted the classic thalamic these have been later further the louvain symposium at standardization of in of the normal human topometry and standardized amsterdam made the recommendation to call the classical subdivisions one region may be made up of one or several these may have one if there is a particular coafference for the region separated by the superior lamella is the anterior region the region separated medially by the medial lamina is the lateral region almost separated from the thalamic mass are the geniculate bodies the remaining isothalamus is made up of the medial region medial to the medial and with no complete separation in of the posterior regio or pulvinar the last two represent a huge medioposterior the classical separation into receiving subcortical afferences or which would cannot be retained as the lateral region and the geniculate bodies indeed receive strong lower afferences and can be seen as the part of the the medioposterior in most of its volume does not receive subcortical afferents and abundant afferences from the cortex but in essentially ventral in fact receives subcortical such as spinothalamic or the anterior region receives a particular afference that is not entirely subcortical or indirectly from the thalamic regions may be functionally the elements of the lateral region have been frequently separated into ventral and dorsal fact named this subdivision no more hold cytoarchitectonics have partly what differentiates anatomofunctional parts are the major afferent systems present in the thalamus as terminal parts of axons and axonal analyses of the distribution of all the axonal ending coming from the same source show that they occupy together an own space in the which is called a such a main territory do no mix or overlap in primates with neighbouring territories this is what made possible a solid partition of the these territories may cover one or several the analyses of the geometry of the main afferent terrirories in macaques have shown that a dorsal element on transverse sections is simply the posterior part of the preceding there are thus no this is one reason why the nomenclature selected by the nomina anatomica and the anatomica is hardly the evolution of the thalamus follows that of the cortex and there are differences including between primates world monkeys and old old world and which means that a universal nomenclature valid in all species is not simply the superior region comprises two elements that were linked during a long time and were later wrongly the and the or nucleus lateralis the nucleus divided into several entities in is undivided in the anterior and nuclei are separated from the lateral and medial regions by the lamella superior and are everywhere surrounded by a capsule of white including the lamina the second nucleus or is posterior and in succession to the the two are constituted in the same the main difference is their mode of both receives information from the of the hippocampus but in one case indirectly and in the other the efferent axons of the subiculum follow the at the anterior part of the part of them go down to the the neurons of the mammillary bodies give axons forming the thick and dense which ends in the nucleus another part of the subicular axons does not end in the mamillary body at the level of the foramen of they turn some of them end into the anterior nucleus but a great quantity end in the nucleus the selective target of the efferent axons from the anterior nucleus is the that of the superfial nucleus is the posterior with some the axons of these parts of the cingulate linked through the large bundle located at the base of the cingulate return to the this circuit referred to as the a proposed mechanism of said by its author to be the substrate for there have been many further other elaborations the circuit was in fact not close hippocampal in the second the superficial not taken into has similar connections and participates in other close or linked the better known effect of the lesion of mamillary of the mamillothamic bundle and the if is a particular amnesia the corresponds to the part which is located medial to the lamina in the anterior part of the the oral intralaminar cellular part makes a clear this is no more true posteriorly with the due to their constitution and the two constitute a common set corresponding to the largest mass of the human in non human the medial nucleus named is subdivided into several it is admitted that this is no longer the case in which makes comparison even with old world monkeys some subcortical afferences are documented in macaques there are no arguments in favour of their existence in the majority of the afferences comes from the reciprocated by corticothalamic in the spatial distribution of the connection was said to be and and the primate dorsomedial nucleus and its projection to the frontal medial cortical areas being linked to medial parts of the nucleus and lateral dorsal to lateral this is also true in the strong interrelation between the medial nucleus and the frontal cortex is known for lobotomies were intended to cut this there are however other mediocortical with the cingulate the insular cortex and also with the premotor pulvinar means pillow in it constitutes the posterior pole of the thalamus and its posterior border is indeed anteriorly there is only an uncomplete boundary with the medial the two have in fact common connections both thalamocortical and this is the case for instance for the the usual subdivisions do not fit with the distribution of cortical it is common to find the description of a lateralis posterior this is simply a part of the pulvinar passing over the lateral region and giving in transverse sections the image of a ventral and a dorsal sagittal sections show that the ensemble is a single curved the whole receives in the same almost identical a main medial part receives flat islands of axonal terminations from the temporal and preoccipital only one part of the pulvinar is the intergeniculate or inferior which receives tectal afferents and which has a visuotopic in the postero inferior part of the thalamus is a place which raises not solved this is a place of endings of spinothalamic terminal axonal the spinothalamic tracts ends in three the vcp and it close to in the third place of the basal formation a classical in a place that was attributed to lower is particular only in one place named the nucleus basalis nodalis that was claimed by some to be the only relay of pain messages from layer i of the spinal this place has been shown to send axons to the in fact vcp also conveys painful this is made up of the two that are located ventrally at the surface of the below the they are of highly specific audition for the first and vision for the they differentiate early in ontogenesis and for the lateral or partially for the medial separate from the thalamic they are however specialized but authentical isothalamic the receives axons from auditory from the peripheral auditory information goes to the cochlear from through the cochlear axons reach the superior olivary complex of both axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which ends in the axons from the inferior colliculus constitute the and end in the medial the thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the located in the center of the superior temporal see the is made up of different cellular strata separated by parallel to the the stratae and the most are the other are from the the axons of the optic nerves go directly to the geniculate the nasal component of the optic nerves axons issued from the nasal field of the retina of both crosses at the axons of the temporal field do not this is very important in clinical after the axons form the visual tracts turning around the peduncles and arriving int the polar anterior part of the geniculate retinal axons from the controlateral retina end in stratae and those from the ipsilateral retina end in and the axons from the lateral geniculate through the optic end in the primary visual cortex around the calcarine see this corresponds to the part of isothalamus located laterally to the medial lamina and in front of the pulvinar noyau externe of dejerine after it receives abundant and diverse infrathalamic some main afferent systems occupy a particular portion in the lateral several are spatially this allows functionally significant other afferent systems may end in one or the other main territories to which they are still other can end in several main the topographic description of the territories was made using experiments in this showed that they are no dorsal what was believed to be dorsal was simply the posterior extension of the more anterior this makes it difficult to follow the terminologia anatomica to follow common lateral nuclei are called it is today possible to transfer the data experimentally obtained in monkeys to the human brain using the sequence described by vogt la myelocytoarchitecture du thalamus du hold starting from caudally one may describe the lemniscal made up of two components cutaneous or tactile and deep the cerebellar territory also made up of two the pallidal territory and the nigral territory tied to vcm into the classic arcuate nucleus fact it has neurons of an own it does not receive lemniscal afferent and is thus not a part of it receives axons from the nucleus of the solitary its thalamocortical neurons send axons to the located in the opercule of the gustatory the nuclei corresponding to the lemniscal territory are called the tactile part vpc is the posterior part of the lateral in front of the it is the addition of a lateral nucleus vpl and of the superior part of the classic arcuate nucleus vpc receives axons from the dorsal column nuclei located in the lower medulla the medial and the starting from these axons go ventralwards and decussate the other still in the medulla forming the axons from the two sides form the thick medial lemniscus close to the it separates in order to reach the lower border of the two in this the axons terminate forming lamellae and a the axons conveying information from the leg are the most lateral and the most those conveying information from the mouth and tongue are the most medial and ventral the axonal arborisations are rather small and very the mediator of the lemniscus system is the thalamocortical axons of the vpc send their axons to the and where there is also a clear somatotopic within the somesthetic physiological including in have found a spatial separation between the representation of the tactile and the deep friedman and jones and

not clearly there are poor physiological starting from the two sources from the medial pallidum and nigra have spatially thalamic the pallidal territory arrives in evolution as a lateral addition to the nigal forming a new nucleus individualized by another name the nucleus ventralis on the contrary there is no more vm receices convergent afferences in rodents and vo receives its pallidal afferent axons from the the trajectory of pallidal afferent axons is axons form first the and the which place the axons on the medial border of the from the axons cross the internal capsule as the axons

pallidal axons within the territory is wide with terminal yelnik francois percheron tande tracing of axons in the three dimensional morphology and distribution of pallidal axons projecting to both the lateral region of the thalamus and the central complex in brain parent and and the pallidofugal motor fiber motor system in this offers few chance for a fine somatotopic the territory is stained for the mediator of the connection is the inhibitor the thalamocortical neurons send their axons to the supplementary motor area the premotordorsal and medial and to a lesser extend to the motor the nigral afferences come from the pars reticulata of the the axons do not constitute a conspicuous they are placed medially to the pallidal and ascend almost a part of the territory is posterior and

the capital to summon his daughter and chai shao li jiancheng and li yuanji secretly travelled to but left the li zhiyun at even before li li and chai shao at the urging of li left on his own while she went into arrived at li yuan declaring that he wanted to support emperor grandson the prince of then nominally in charge at as while honoring emperor yang as in sui officials arrested li took him to and executed li yuan made li jiancheng and li shimin both key but the younger li yuanji was although li yuan created him the duke of when li yuan subsequently began his campaign toward he left li yuanji in charge at later that after he captured and declared yang you emperor emperor but kept power for himself as he created li yuanji the duke of qi and put him in charge of the commanderies around in spring emperor then at jiangdu in modern was killed in a coup led by the general when the news arrived at li yuan had emperor gong yield the throne to establishing as its emperor he created li yuanji the prince of it was said while he was at li yuanji was arrogant and and he often held military exercises with his s and involving use of actual armor and and they suffered many casualties in these including injuries to li yuanji his chen shanyi tried to get him to change his but he had his guards batter her to in spring when his assistant yuwen xin reported this to emperor emperor gaozu temporarily removed him from his less than a month with the people of taiyuan petitioning to have li yuanji kept in emperor gaozu restored traditional historians allege that li yuanji pressured the people into petitioning emperor in summer liu wuzhou launched an attack on the taiyuan and li yuanji sent the general zhang da to resist despite protestations that the army given him was too small to resist when zhang was in fact he surrendered to liu and served as guide in subsequent liu soon put taiyuan under and while li yuanji initially repelled liu was soon back and again had taiyuan under in fall li yuanji fled with his wife and concubines back to and liu captured moving his capital from mayi in modern li shimin defeated liu and recaptured the in with li shimin leading the army in sieging the capital of rival zheng li yuanji served as li when subsequently another rival the prince of came to li shimin left li yuanji at luoyang to continue the siege and to watch while he himself advanced to to engage li shimin defeated and captured and in li shimin received the most honors stemming from the but li yuanji also received promotions and when emperor gaozu had the government mint new there were strict prohibitions against minting by any other except that li shimin and li yuanji were each granted the right to have three mints and was granted the right to have one later that when general rose in resistance to tang rule and took over all of former li shimin and li yuanji were sent against li shimin defeated liu in spring forcing liu to flee to eastern they attacked another rebel the prince of when li shimin returned to and left li yuanji in charge of the operations against liu returned from eastern tujue and again occupied old and li yuanji was not able to stop an intense rivalry had developed between li who as the oldest son was emperor and li as li while a capable general was overshadowed by li who had done much to solidify tang rule by destroying liu wang dou and li yuanji supported li jiancheng in this as he believed that if li jiancheng became li jiancheng would create him crown since their mother duchess dou had died in the fact that li jiancheng and li yuanji had better relations with emperor favored young s than li shimin did take a notable since those concubines helped rehabilitate li standing before emperor causing him to no longer consider making li shimin crown prince as he considered at one after liu heita returned from eastern tujue and reoccupied old xia li at the suggestion of his staff members and volunteered to lead the army against emperor gaozu thus sent li assisted by li against around the new year with forced bogged down while attacking wei prefecture in modern li jiancheng and li yuanji engaged him at guantao in modern handan as crushing liu fled north toward eastern but was ambushed and captured by his own official zhuge dewei who delivered him to li li jiancheng executed china was by this point almost completely unified by at one li yuanji tried to persuade li jiancheng to have li shimin assassinated when li shimin was visiting li but li not having the heart to kill a stopped li yuanji from doing in li jiancheng requisitioned a number of soldiers from the general the prince of to supplement his guard against emperor when this was revealed to emperor emperor gaozu rebuked li jiancheng and exiled his guard commander keda zhi li jiancheng nevertheless requested the commandant at qing prefecture in modern yang to conscript presumably to guard against li the officers erzhu huan and qiao gongshan informed emperor gaozu that li jiancheng was encouraging yang to start a rebellion so that they could seize power emperor then at renzhi palace in modern was and summoned li then at to renzhi li jiancheng briefly flirted the idea of occupying and not accepting the but eventually reported to renzhi palace to request emperor gaozu put him under when yang heard yang and emperor after promising li shimin that he would be made crown sent li shimin to attack emperor li jiancheng would be removed as crown prince and created the prince of shu he would then send li jiancheng to the modern once li shimin li emperor and the all spoke on li and emperor gaozu changed his released li and allowed him to return to and remain as crown emperor gaozu only blamed the discord between his sons on li staff members wang gui and wei ting and li staff member exiling yang was subsequently assassinated by his own later that emperor troubled by repeated eastern tujue seriously considered burning to the ground and moving the capital to fancheng in modern a suggestion that li li and the chancellor agreed li shimin and the plan was not carried li shimin himself was sending his confidants to luoyang to build up personal control of the army after an incident in which li shimin suffered a severe case of food poisoning after feasting at li palace an event that both emperor gaozu and li shimin apparently interpreted as an assassination attempt emperor gaozu considered sending li shimin to guard luoyang to prevent further but li jiancheng and li after consulting each believed that this would only give li shimin an opportunity to build up his personal power and therefore opposed emperor gaozu therefore did not carry out the by li shimin was fearful that he would be killed by li and his staff members and were repeatedly encouraging li shimin to attack li jiancheng and li yuanji first while wei zheng was encouraging li jiancheng to attack li shimin li jiancheng persuaded

beginning to outsource an increasing amount of their animation production to asian particularly while other companies are outsourcing animation from india for commercials and computer a factor making india an outsourcing destination for animation films is its vast base of english speaking which requires understanding of the english language in order to the animated media to the audio benefits from this particular talent that the indian workforce a number of animation companies in the country are also creating skilled manpower for the animation market through various training overall the main reason why foreign entertainment firms are flocking to india is the cost advantage the country as an us animators can cost about an in they cost an toonz animation offers animation at per cent to per

stick to the facts and confidently and sensitively approach the sometimes less than complimentary aspects of personality and do not pull to have done any less would be doing marriott and his fans a for example after many years of substance abuse became quite at his very worst often after alcohol and drug binges and several days with no he was said to become a violent melvin the also lifelong naturally hyper and generally good natured mischievous nature that sometimes gradually manifested into mania and to the end of his marriott denied that he had an addictive problem with his denial was probably to save his elderly parents and children from worrying about according to interviews and quotes mentioned in the band members and his first wife jenny rylance claim that cocaine and from the early seventies at certainly played a large part in his marriage in may to jenny was said to have been one of the happiest times of his life and when she left him due to his drug and alcohol problems in he was arguably never the same again and for a while fell into a spiral of he was always a workaholic and would think nothing of spending days in his recording studio without sleeping or as with

years he was for the most part virtually throughout his music career he remained true to he never sold too also details how and why marriott never received royalties for any of his and was constantly ripped off by the big record companies and managers such as after the demise of humble he was left with nothing to show for his efforts and returned to england yet owing thousands to the in fact during much of his life he often had very little to show for his years of he eventually decided to shun the contracts that always promised much but delivered older and and with health he decided to

devastated friends and the back of the book also catalogues all the known song releases and ever recorded by marriott including guest appearances and unfortunately this book could be criticised by some for some mistakes and and is said to take some of own jokes about his life as for there is said to be no record of marriott burning down his school and this was said to be one of many wind up however the authors here take it as also the lyrics quoted are often this is downright unforgivable for marriott fans and their lack of respect for the music is an music journalist paolo hewitt has

disturbance in orientation will propagate through the and the equation describes certain aspects of such in the models for liquid crystals considered it is assumed that there is no fluid so that only the of the molecules is of within the the orientation is described by a field of unit vectors for nematic liquid there is no difference between orienting a molecule in the direction or in the and the vector field is then called a the potential energy density of a director field is usually assumed to be given by the energy functional gennes prost where the positive coefficients are known as the elastic coefficients of and the kinetic energy is often neglected because of the high viscosity of liquid hunter and investigated the case when viscous damping is ignored and a kinetic energy term is included in the then the governing equations for the dynamics of the director field are the for the where is a corresponding to the constraint they restricted their attention to where the director field takes the special form this assumption reduces the lagrangian to and then the equation for the angle becomes there are trivial constant solutions corresponding to states where the molecules in the liquid crystal are perfectly linearization around such an equilibrium leads to the linear wave equation which allows wave propagation in both directions with speed so the nonlinear equation can be expected to behave in order to study waves for large one looks for asymptotic solutions of the form where inserting this into the one finds at the order that a simple renaming and rescaling of the variables that transforms this into the the analysis was later generalized by and hunter who allowed the director field to point in any but with the spatial dependence still only in the then the lagrangian is the corresponding equations are coupled nonlinear wave equations for the angles and with corresponding to and to the previous case splay is recovered by taking but one can also consider coupled waves where both and asymptotic expansions similar to that above lead to a system of after renaming and rescaling the takes the form u where is related to and to this system the second

standardized equipment for deployment and tailoring the applications to the special needs of an operator on a single site of this page on implementing locating systems refers to according to locating with please get informed also with the section of the to make rtls a careful preparatory process of deployment is this has aspects with staff and aspects with planning the finally covering the aspects of the operational assessment in coincidence with the innovative technology and applied technical equipment is often subject of adverse feelings of the people this may lead to a queer judgement of the protagonists and proponents may cultivate an atmosphere of advocating free from the antagonists and resitiance fighters may do quite the care ful information prolicy is required to provent from such it is a mandatory requirement to make allparies buy in to the solution in full conscience of the problems with and without many approaches from interested parties are initially asking for none of these applications solely pays for the infrastructure only conjunstion of at least two aspects covered will pay back for the prospective calculations of an roi with aspects of security only must be taken with there is no all aspects may contribute to a sound but not all of them at the same it is required that the management and the staff do not tangle the interests and work hard to meet in a mutual understanding of a phased introduction of the new and there is that in the all aspects will at least be if not fully a possible strategy is to address the weak targets assets and planning may extend to mapping the propagation conditions in the operational such solutions are to compensate partially for a missing travel time when is the only means to but even in or systems the assessment of propagation is required at least to place the anchor nodes regular patterns for anchor point deployment might please the aesthetic sense of but must not cope with technical the implementing of any rtls must be tailored to the specific needs in the operational area and for the support of users of the obtained there is no standard solution to serve special requirements without that does not require entirely new development for each but at least some sound parametrising for such for the appropriate set of parameters for the implementation the purchaser must take into account the this bouquet of considerations will lead to a careful phasing of the implementing above all steps the specifying of the various layers and for the diverse aspects of system layout is the key to an rtls according to the definitions given with iso is composed of largely autonomous wireless nodes that communicate to each for an rtls solution the interface to other networks is not but for advantage of the using any rtls has a link to another network to enable access to data for locating an object or a some reference requirements must be where it does not require any further some common features of rtls infrastructure requirements may some rtls systems in the market provide excellent accuracy for locating moving the objects or individuals bearing an rtls a fair comparison of systems should take into at which expense such accuracy is digging holes in the wiring walls with copper or spinning densely meshed nets of reference nodes under ceilings may appear as reasonable for steady but this is contradictory to any rapid deployment rtls is a mature the quantities in production are still on the this rules also the integrating of functions with most of the solutions offered are well contained hardware however the degree of integration this is at stake for the cost of any the better the integration is the lower the cost for the transponders will this applies as well to all types of for fixmount for personal carriage and for application to dead on the other price is not the absolute the balance between benefit and cost rules whether transponders are chip integration as well rules the power consumption in this again has to be as functions like active ranging always consume more power than just passive receiver normally in advanced wireless communications the communicating units on air are autonomous wireless that feature of autonomous operation describes the advantage that basically and beyond unconditionally required knowledge for direct addressing no administering is an easy approach is unilateral broadcasting to start a polling but this invites unwanted for exclusion of unauthorized third party nodes and inclusion of nodes for membership in a local at least some identification and some exchange on encryption is recommended to keep unauthorized intruders such enrollment procedures may be performed with any node that has the knowledge of accepted additional identification and passwords along with required otherwise any node would be able to interfere with the members of the lesser advanced systems may have limitations in the following such rtls implementations do not comply with the referred standards according to any rtls may use its specially designed of channels in any available ism wireless communications some aspects recommend the choice of a band and bandwidth that may support just the locating and some communications functionality beyond and without impact to other already existing there is an approach to an rtls which is compatible with other users in the same ism band and which is currently in the process of this approach is capable of locating and communicating in dense populations and with reasonable channel the proposal is under discussion in dis information technology locating systems part this standard proposal is taking the basing ieee standard as a specification for communications through nanotron and as a this communications approach led with the manufacturing of nanotron to an industrially designed including a metering engine on the basis of symmetric toa on a homogenous these chips are ready for implementing in general wireless systems as well as for rtls implementation with making use of the wlan channel scheme according to ieee and thus enabling proper coexistence of wlan networking with rtls locating in the very same the competing requests from any nodes in any ad hoc advanced network or any administered legacy network create the mandatory requirement is a proper strategy for avoiding collision or at least live with the competition and be the basic issue for any rtls implementation is the capability to provide metering beyond anti collision the secondary issue is to enable communication beyond both are tasks before coping with the population the solution may not be just a deterministic granularity of the rtls deployment is not just a question of resolution and but also a parameter for coexistence of adjacent the capability of an rtls to cope with high density of nodes supersedes the accuracy in case of two rtls node bearers adjacent to each the accuracy of locating each of both might degrade but an effect that the locating function might fail due to close vicinity of two or more bearers should be taken as a hard disqualification the option to locate an object implies the need to power the unit to be located on the this limits the available functions with the moving despite the locating of vehicles there is no power line with moving persons or dead the production lots and the preparations to integrate functions with a processor platform limits the reach of consider the following nexus of taking any actual design of cell net phones with an integrated gps function as a comparable the locating should be comparable in operational this is the target for product development on mid do not forget the design history in the last two decades to arrive at the functional complexity of cell net phones of the locating engine is a part of an rtls providing the computing of location from generic details see under generally with moving nodes the validity of location data is limited to the motion characteristics of the nodes hence the quality of the systems approach is related to the dynamics behaviour of the respective systems users of wireless systems and of navigational aids will know in detail the effects of any obstacles to direct sight and any interference of more than two transmitters the cardinal quality measure for any such condition is the latency time to cope with relocation of any latency is the sum of times from request through reaction till availability of an answer with the the first proper locating with an rtls should be ready for display in much less than a minutes such quality metrics should be independent of any supporting as inertial track extrapolations or optical system all of such options are welcome to improve an rtls system but they should not be taken into account when comparing different rtls mobile nodes on the move may change their location without prior they even may change their direction without prior hence the quality of the location data has to take into account the dynamics of the motion in terms of covered distance and of current angular velocity user requirements often start with as an rtls is an operational means and no gauging this aspect must be carefully balanced between benefit and dealing static precision as a primary issue is just as an rtls is designed for dynamic the key parameter is dynamic precision with respect to operational an rtls solution properly supporting decisions on the move is the design momentary locating errors may infer pretension of correctness all an excellent rtls will serve the user with an accuracy in the range of his very own that may be in the case of individuals an accuracy of about or down to or a reasonably good rtls will serve the user with an accuracy not lesser than a multiplicity of his very own dimensions in the range of about or down to or these error margins provide proper support for typical operational to obtain benefit with any rtls implementation and with full the demand for high accuracy should not encumber the balance of cost and an rtls will not replace a measurement subsystem for dynamic positioning or any topographic or geodesic the essence of rtls design beyond metering is as in all measuring erroneous results superpose the wanted correct this starts with followed by statistical errors and ends in heavily threatening multi path there are several approaches possible to defeat these thriving for accuracy may be performed at the expense of of latency times till availability or of stability of the as multipath propagation is ubiquitous with wireless there is no escape to prevent from multiple reception and resulting response to any for an rtls the multipath propagation is a burden in the metering therefore strategies to assess the response is such strategies apply in subsequent this list may be extended for the purpose of the operational another escape is hybridization of the system to enable stronger conditions and to provide supporting external sample the solution may not be just a deterministic mathematical modeling is a prerequisite for an rtls providing the computing of location from details see under locating the other aspect is the mathematics based model of addressing not the locating but the wrapping of the obtained coordinates with the operational to apply any rtls system must address some requirement to make information available on the it makes no sense to deploy any when the aspect does not drive the in rtls shows many resemblance to location based services of mobile phone such typical application may be this list may be extended upon relevant an rtls is not a radio detection and ranging but an autonomously operating and functionally cooperative system of basically equal therefore there is no central scanner function nor any central processing instance nor any otherwise specialized rtls node to collect and compute data in the locating process for any other node beyond as well there is no specialized higher qualified reader function nor any lower qualified and dumb beacon as the object to be located in logistics applications normally is the means to transport objects of varying the identifying of the objects transported must coincide with the locating of the transporting this requires other independent systems deployed that shall cooperate with the rtls support at least on informations systems basically any rtls node shall obtain its own location in a cooperative measurement process and hence shall be capable to compute its own location with its own local additionally any other rtls node shall be capable to receive the readily computed information from other nodes on location of these and further it may depend on the user which nodes will be excelled with signaling and display capabilities to support the defined operational tasks with the rtls for the sake of an economized systems the qualification of the wireless nodes in an rtls implementation may differ to serve for distinct special fine tuning of network configurations may be possible to reduce the effort in resources tailored to the defined operational this may apply to permanent or temporal deployment as well as to the spatial distribution aiming at the line of sight a basic application for rtls is the locating of nodes that normally should not recurrently locating such nodes then simply confirms each node being in the determined place and in such control may be achieved with active rfid as well as far as the resolution and stability for the actual location were of no in any other case the locating capability of rtls with distance metering and locating engine trumps any rfid with bare rssi as far as budgeting is sound and design is an rtls shall be aligned with other systems yet the rtls systems is just designed to provide a locating capability that may a user of an rtls will be happy just to make use of the special functions of such system under any roofing or other confinement of additionally for any temporal deployment and for various operational conditions in open a hybrid solution may offer new versatility that will not be addressed by any purely satellite based for the user of any rfid labeling there may be full satisfaction with identifying any object right in the scope of a manually held reader or with a but in the complex event of identifying objects by means of any tool requires at least three the latter term of location is mostly when rfid readers are operated in confined to satisfy the perpetuate desire for maximum the question is where the object moved or stood in the moment of identifying this aspect will gain momentum in as rfid is still mostly competing with or besides the basic the rtls function generally requires power source on the so rtls is not approach compared to tracking and tracing as concurrent or posterior computing of a trajectory covers the dynamic aspects of rtls the aim of ranging and locating is somewhat whereas the track or trace serves protracted interests of motion any information about momentary or temporary location of an object or a person may be collected to form a track or just to trace the instance or the this in effect simply indicates the need to prove willful acceptance of services through the client under any rtls control as deemed mandatory with any other location based service focusing individuals in wired or wireless unauthorised or otherwise impermissible tracking or tracing people with any technical means without such willful agreement will surely lead to dismissal of such services with the community in industrial environment ordinary tasking covers fulfilment of planned and scheduled thus in industry any spontaneous locating will mostly not be the key this coincides with the systematic weakness of real time where knowledge about a steady motion may support well the computing of actual in any emergency or military environment there is a tendency to ask for spontaneous determining of an unknown added with the requirement to perform as well on unknown territories or in confinements without any available this appears as a completely different task concerning a supporting any rtls system implementation will make use of a priori knowledge about locations of all available information about residing nodes or other nodes that disclose their such information may be just the address for networking and may comprise properly surveyed locations of reference this a priori knowledge is complimentary to all knowledge yet obtained in operation and compiled in tracing is understood as elaboration from recorded data and therefore never operated in real tracing makes use of data collected by means of tracking the actual tracking of nodes may contribute to collecting data for a trajectory in a data base and may then be presented in plots with underlaid maps or the anchor nodes in such tracking data sets may be the trajectories of the traveling nodes may be recorded with a composite data set of locations of touched nodes and intermediate metering to be prepared to segregate corn and there must be an appropriate specification form the very the interested operating party must set out its own this may be answered by the offering manufacturing party with an appropriate test that will show the capabilities of the rtls under the potential purchaser should stress his brain to identify the critical which he deems important for operational as there rtls shall be capable to derive locating on the en on the move and during this results in some local display of vicinity and presentation of results is the minimum output of any this may be provided for moving entities or for any observer in the area of operations or apart from the rtls user gets the location of himself or of the objects under control the displaying of such information is performed visually on a map or in other alternatively the change of location may be indicated aurally with sound the applicability of rtls for operational tasks is bound to the stability of the location it is neither an advantage to get a false information about which may appear in real time but with no real nor may an unstable result support spontaneous erratic jumps with every when the user cannot recognize the computed location as having read till this please feel free to contribute to a knowledge poll on rtls with this click here to take a the survey is composed to show some alternative features for an rtls in direct confrontation and not to put a burden on clarity of explanations beyond local the common requirement with locating rtls nodes is some feedback to those monitoring systems and persons in charge that control the work the rtls system shall be capable to report locations of moving objects in conjunction with some data transfer to the destination of this many of the systems designed in the past do not support such data transfer in the very same communications as with gps operating just in normally data reporting is transmitted via this leads to the following alternatives for rtls the respective variety applies for the feedback with any type of moving rtls the scope and complexity of possible applications determine an unlimited plurality of the rtls concept does not constrain respective operational all additional references within

alexander the have come to conclude that the stories about closely parallel certain legends about alexander the great found in ancient hellenistic and christian there is some evidence to identify the arabic with alexander the there is also a long history of monotheistic religions coopting the historical this leads to the theologically controversial conclusion that these legends are the source of the story of in the alexander the great was an immensely popular figure in the and cultures of the and almost immediately after his death a body of legend began to accumulate about his exploits and life over the became increasingly fantastic as well as collectively this tradition is called the and some recensions feature such vivid episodes as alexander ascending through the air to or journeying to the bottom of the sea in a glass as the persisted in popularity over the it was assumed by various neighboring of particular significance was its incorporation into and later legendary in the jewish tradition alexander was initially a figure of representing the vain or covetous ruler who is ignorant of larger spiritual yet their belief in a god forced jewish interpreters of the alexander tradition to come to terms with undeniable temporal why would a god show such favor to an unrighteous this plus acculturation to led to a more positive jewish interpretation of the alexander in its most neutral form this was typified by having alexander show deference to either the jewish people or the symbols of their in having the great conqueror thus acknowledge the essential truth of the or ethical the prestige of alexander was harnessed to the cause of jewish eventually jewish writers would almost completely depicting him as a righteous gentile or even a believing the christianized peoples of the near inheritors of both the hellenic as well as judaic strands of the further theologized alexander until in some stories he was depicted as a the christian legends turned the ancient greek conqueror alexander iii into alexander believing implying that he was a believer in monotheism to known historical issued in the name of depicting alexander with the horns of posthumous silver issued in the name of the chieftain minted at the site of mleiha in around this coin is an imitation based on coin types of as said the literally means alexander the great was often depicted as one possessing in particular the ancient greek coins minted in the name of alexander the great depict alexander with the distinctive horns of amon on his the influence of alexander the great spread even to the coinage of ancient in the late silver coins depicting alexander with horns were used as a principal coinage in arabia and were issued by an ruler by the name of who ruled in the region of the the reason that alexander the great was depicted with the horns of amon in ancient greek coinage is that in alexander was received as the son of the ancient egyptian god and the god amon was depicted as alexander then styled himself as the son of seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own and to have required its acceptance by others the cities perforce but often the n decree alexander wishes to be a let him be a in the a christian legend has it in one of his prayers to alexander god thou hast made me horns upon my and the translator adds in a footnote that in the version of this is always referred to as two the describes a story about building a near the place of the between two in order to enclose the nations of who great mischief in the the relevant passages from the building of gates in the mountains by alexander to repel the barbarian peoples identified with gog and magog has ancient the century jewish historian mentions that nation of the whom we have previously mentioned elsewhere as being travelled through passage which king alexander shut up with iron josephus also records that the people of the were synonymous with the according to this merely indicates that the main elements of the story were already in place six centuries before the not that the story itself was known in the cohesive form apparent in the mentions that hordes of the huns had poured forth all the way from had their haunts between the icy tanais and the rude where the gates of alexander keep back the wild peoples behind the in his commentary on jerome identifies the nations located beyond the caucasus and near as gog and legends speak of the also known as built by to enclose the gog and magog several variations of the legend can be in the alexander the great built a gate of iron between two at the end of the to prevent the armies of gog and magog from ravaging the this alexander legend bears a remarkable resemblance to the story of an historian notes a version of the christian legend describes an apocryphal letter from alexander to his wherein he several historical figures have searched for and legends about the gate itself of the world by from this was also the first printed map in in the encloses the gog and magog hoard behind a mighty between two preventing the gog and magog from invading the the also explains that in the end gog and magog will destroy this allowing them to hoard to ravage the in the version of the christian alexander the great encloses the gog and magog hoard behind a mighty gate between two preventing the gog and magog from invading the in it is written in the christian legend that in the god will cause the gate of gog and magog to be allowing the gog and magog hoard to ravage the in order to understand the legend of the that is in order to understand how a single gate between two mountains could prevent the gog and magog hoard from invading the one must understand that the christian legend was written in a time when most people believed that the is the earth was described as being flat and surrounded by great and these mountains were in turn surrounded by some land followed by a fetid ocean it is this tract of land between the mountains and the ocean sea that alexander enclosed gog and so that they could not cross the mountains and invade the the legend describes old wise explaining this and of the earth to and then alexander subsequently setting out to enclose gog and magog behind a mighty gate between a narrow passage at the end of the flat view of the world to the homeric conception of the world involved a circular surrounded by the mountains in surrounded by the sun emerges from underneath the traveling along the fixed dome of the and is shown rising from a peculiar aspect of the story about in the is that it describes travelling to the rising place of the and the place of the also finds a people living by the place of the and explains that these people have no shelter from the the also describes travelling to the place where the sun sets into a murky it may not be clear what these verses refer ancient muslim of the known as the as the s of and understood these verses of the to be literal descriptions of a cosmology of the universe wherein the earth is flat and wherein the sun rises and sets into a sea that is surrounding the flat earth the canonical literature also contains a passage that may easily be misconstrued as implying a similar cosmology until one realises that in all islamic theology the is a metaphysical entity in the spiritual meaning that the prostration refers to a spiritual not its physical orbiting as shall be this passage is similar to one found in the christian legends about narrated abu the peace be upon asked me at you know where the sun goes the time of i and his apostle know he goes till it prostrates itself underneath the throne and takes the permission to rise and it is permitted and then time will come it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be but it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the and that is the interpretation of the statement of the sun runs its fixed course for a term that is the decree of the exalted in the modern scholars such as zaghlool agree now that the word does not literally mean that alexander came to the setting of the in arabic the word is commonly used in reference to anything in the sky above to indicate time of in other and subsequent verses the quran uses the word or to mean a literal the word is derived from which means to go meaning to go the word can mean any body of it is most likely that the or waters refer to the black an outlet of water near the town of as a alexander would have conquered this land near the ancient town of lychnis day and had to decide the fate of the or the people referred in the perhaps an almost identical discourse is found in the christian legends about alexander the the christian legend about alexander explains that when the sun sets into the fetid it enters into heaven and immediately bows down in obedience to in the alexander travels to the fetid sea at the end of the as mentioned the previous this legend was understood from a point of the legend explained that wise told alexander that at the ends of the flat earth is a sea in which the rises from the west and in which the sun sets in the the waters of this sea were imagined as being fetid place and intensely hot from the heat of the sun when it rose from the upon hearing about this from the wise the legendary alexander sets out to the end of the flat earth and witnesses the sun rising from the fetid according to the christian at this where the sun rises out of a terrible alexander found a people who have no shelter from the sun which is literally rising out of an intensely hot and his advances eastward ended at the fringes of the and christian legendary accounts both have it that alexander the great travelled to the ends of the in particular to the place on the earth where the sun sets and the place on the earth where the sun rises this allegory served the legendary accounts to convey the theme of great exploits as a in the context of the travelling to the places of the setting and rising of the would imply having travelled across the entire many modern muslims insist that the descriptions of travels are just allegorical references to travels towards the east and the and do not imply travelled to the ends of the the stories about travels to the eastern and western extents of the world are a legendary which built up over centuries throughout the lands conquered by alexander and after his from depicting the persian name for as it has been the early muslim scholars generally identified the of the with alexander the in the centuries that was often thought of by muslims as a early islamic civilization would produce its own legendary traditions about alexander the particularly in with the the found its way to an honored place in ironic outcome considering hostility to the national enemy who not only destroyed the glorious but was also directly responsible for centuries of persian domination by foreign islamic persian accounts of the alexander known as the combined the material about some of which

become subject among muslim scholars of numerous most of the factual details of the as those that appear to be included in the fantastic deeds as well as his implied have little or no basis in historical and if is this confusion between fact and legend could possibly be a source of embarrassment to some muslim even if not to the historical personality of alexander the great was by the legendary traditions of both judaism and which chose to portray alexander as believing a devout it was in this context that the legends of alexander the great reached the it is not difficult to understand how the pagan alexander may have ended in the tafsir of the to be an islamic the belief that the contains passages derived from pagan rather than its own internal epistemological standard that itself establishes the legitimacy of similar has led some to ajudge the story a serious theological ancient muslim scholars of the islam were unaware of such theological but even in modern some influential mainstream muslims as have endorsed the traditional islamic view which identified with alexander the judging the theological problems that could be posed most secular scholars studying islam have been concord in their view that there is strong evidence supporting the conclusion that is none other than alexander the belief in the infallibility of the has made this position untenable in the opinions of many modern muslim some muslims take the position that nothing about the identity of is known except what is stated in the other they assert that there is no evidence linking the identity of to a historical other muslim such as and have suggested that is and not alexander the though this theory has been proposed only recently and is not much considered by mostly due to the

when killed an elephant named and loudly proclaimed that ashwathama was knowing that only with his firm adherence to the could tell him for sure if his son had approached yudhisthira for yudhisthira told has however yudhisthira could not make himself tell a despite the fact that if drona continued to the pandavas and the cause of itself would have lost and he va kunjaro which means he is not sure whether elephant or man had knew that yudhisthira would be unable to and had all the warriors beat and cymbals to make as much noise as the words va kunjaro were lost in the tumult and the ruse drona

just to the north of the divide is just east of the water tower sits atop this prominent panther a tributary of the and s has its origin just over the kell is also located on the divide between the big muddy and both major tributaries of the the divide between the casey muddy basin and the kaskaskia basin is about feet west of over a rise that is barely today kell is located on kell a road that serves but seems to go and comes from there is an elevator and a rail line but these were built long after the settlement was one might therefore why did kell ever come into the answer may lie in location at the junction of the before there were pioneer roads tended to follow the or between along these ridges there were only small creeks that could be easily often without even getting feet at the junction of two kell was a natural intersection for pioneer prior to its destruction in the in was the capital of and the economic center of the on the wabash was also an important although these centers were mainly accessible by there was also an overland trail between the natural route from fort kaskaskia to fort vincennes would start by following the muddy divide to the natural route would start east out of fort climbing to the muddy somewhere near modern the modern nashville road follows the divide through to short segments of the pioneer road appear along the divide between richview and the road from walnut hill to interstate highway is clearly a pioneer road that is following the rather than the surveyed section at it becomes the kell following the modern section boundaries over flat terrain to at the natural road met the beyond kell there was no natural route along divides to fort it would involve a detour of more than miles to avoid major river this is probably what described as marching over in his conquest of to the east of there are three routes to fort all requiring several river the shortest route would be to go straight to vincennes along the modern kell one could also follow the divide two miles north to the modern one could go about eight miles farther north along the divide to the modern at george rogers clark went all the way to and to before crossing the drownded which of these routes was the best depended in part on the in dry the kell road had the fewest river might be too deep in wet in which case the more northerly routes would have shallower but more of to the east of the kell road follows mostly modern quarter section with occasional stretches of pioneer there are traces of many abandoned towns on the road east of as though this was once a major it joins slap out road near about nine miles east of it seems likely that kell was at one time on the main road between fort vincennes and fort this road probably fell into disuse after the destruction of kaskaskia in and became more irrelevant after the state capital was moved to in the first settler near kell was hiram who arrived around around he sold and founded

many numbers are suspected the smallest being the reverse and add process produces the sum of a number and the number formed by reversing the order of its some numbers become palindromes quickly after repeated reversal and and are therefore not lychrel all digit and digit numbers eventually become palindromes after repeated reversal and about of all numbers under resolve into a palindrome in or fewer about solve in steps or here are a few example the first known number starting from that does not apparently form a palindrome is a three digit it is the smallest lychrel number in other certain numbers can be proven to never form a palindrome after repeated reversal and but no such proof has been found for and other base it is d that and other numbers which have not yet yielded a palindrome
